I’ve decided to fix that and bring the stable release in line. Based on what I’ve seen, version 294 is currently the recommended one to be on. I’ll continue releasing and personally testing the experimental builds as well. While the outlook for sideloading isn’t looking particularly bright at the moment, I’ll keep working on and using this app for as long as it’s useful to me.*\r\n\r\n*Also I will try to update the build script as soon as I get the energy so that it uploads the DEB file here for y'all to use.*\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n- **bound.ipa**: BTLoader with Bound name and icon\r\n- **discord.ipa**: BTLoader with original Discord name and icon\r\n- **DEB**: Rootless package for jailbroken devices\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\n- Discord: v294.0\r\n- BTLoader: v1.0.0\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- TrollStore compatibility  \r\n- Optimized for size and performance\r\n",

The ipa file may not work!\r\n\r\nNotes: RealDebrid and AllDebrid's APIs have drastically changed. It is now impossible to retrieve if an item is cached within their database. Ferrite relies on this type of endpoint for rich display of instantly available magnets.\r\n\r\nThe workaround: A user's magnet library now serves as the instant availability cache. There is now a manual `Download to Debrid` button on the context menu for each search result and bookmark so a user can manually queue a magnet for downloading. If the magnet is instantly available, it'll show the file contents as before and add the magnet to the user's instant availability cache (making the debrid badge green!).\r\n\r\nHere's a picture showing where this new button is located:\r\n![Simulator Screenshot - iPhone 16 Pro - 2024-11-27 at 23 24 38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85735a40-2a4b-4aea-bbfa-b0ba0049b3ec)\r\n\r\nAt this time, I do not recommend using RealDebrid or AllDebrid. However, the above workaround makes these services useable. This UI will improve with upcoming releases.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n- Add a context menu button to manually cache a search result/bookmark to debrid\r\n- Adapt to RealDebrid and AllDebrid's API changes\r\n- Fix settings menu showing if a debrid is enabled or disabled\r\n",
