            "localizedDescription": "EnsWilde is a tool utilizing `itunesstored` & `bookassetd` exploits, designed for iPhone and iPad running the latest **iOS Version 26.2b1**.\n\nIt operates as a standalone on-device application, functioning independently like modern apps. It leverages the `sparserestore` exploit to write data to files situated outside of the intended restore location.\n\nWARNING - DISCLAIMER:\nI am not responsible if your device enters a bootloop. Use this software with caution.\nPlease back up your data before using!\n\nFeatures\nDisable call recording notification sound:\nTurns off the audible warning when recording calls.\nMore features coming soon: Development is ongoing to add new capabilities.\n\nGetting Your .mobiledevicepairing File\nTo generate the necessary pairing file, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Download `jitterbugpair` for your specific operating system here: [Jitterbug Releases](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/latest)\n    * Note: On Mac or Linux, you may need to run the following terminal command in the file's directory to make it executable:\n        ```bash\n        chmod +x ./jitterbugpair\n        ```\n2.  Run the program by double-clicking it or executing it via Terminal/PowerShell.\n3.  Share the generated `.mobiledevicepairing` file to your iOS device (via AirDrop, Files, etc.).\n4.  Open the EnsWilde app and select the pairing file.\n\nYou should only have to do this once, unless you lose the file or delete the app's data.*\n\nSetting Up VPN\n1.  Download LocaldevVPN or Stikdebug from the iOS App Store.\n2.  Enable the VPN within that app.\n3.  Launch EnsWilde.",

I can't really without a $99 a year dev account so right now it checks if you are up to date and if your not it will send you to the latest release tab in GitHub\r\n\r\n- **Completely revamped the speed of the player so channels will load much faster now closer to other apps like Smarters IPTV**\r\n\r\n- Slight refresh to the multi view section so channels don't reload every time a new channel is added.\r\n\r\n- mini player doesn't reload every time it is activated same for when the user goes back to full screen.",

This update brings a few major features:\r\n\r\n**Important:** Your feed settings (default feed type and sort) will now be based on your Lemmy account settings. The previous feed settings will now **ONLY** apply to guest accounts. As such, you may have to re-configure your default feed type and default sort type if you were previously using the in-app settings.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf89 New Features\r\n* The inbox page has been completely re-written with an updated design to more closely align with Material 3 design guidelines. There's also been a number of fixes to support quick actions within the inbox page (e.g., voting, saving, etc).\r\n* Thunder now respects more of your Lemmy account settings **including your default feed/sort settings**. You can update your display name, bio, email, and much more in the new Account Settings page. You can also quickly switch between different accounts to modify your Lemmy settings across all your authenticated accounts.\r\n* Additional Lemmy 0.19.x features have been added to Thunder including the ability to hide posts, custom thumbnail support, site content warnings, and more. We are still continuously working on bringing Thunder up to feature-parity with Lemmy, so let us know what features you would like to see.\r\n* Custom user notes/labels are now available in Thunder! This will allow you to add any custom notes to a given user. You can add user labels from the settings page via **Settings -> User Labels**. Alternatively, you can add labels through the action sheets by long pressing on a given comment and selecting **User -> Add User Label**.\r\n\r\n\u2139 General\r\n* The create/edit button for posts and comments have been moved to the markdown toolbar. This should _hopefully_ make it more accessible for one-handed use.\r\n* URL filtering has been added to keyword filters. Simply add a new keyword filter with a URL, and it should be hidden from view.\r\n* Link sharing has been improved to support additional media/external links.\r\n\r\nAnd much much more. I can't go through all the changes in the changelog, but for those who are curious, feel free to check out the full changelog below.\r\n\r\nWe have a Matrix space if you would like to join in on

                    "localizedDescription": "Hey everyone, Thunder v0.4.0 is finally here! This release cycle took a bit longer than usual, but as a result, introduces a lot of new features, changes, and fixes which should make for a even better Thunder experience. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to discuss it in the Thunder community or on GitHub.\r\n\r\nIf you're enjoying Thunder and would like to show some support, star this project on GitHub! This helps gain visibility for the project and allows more contributors to help with the continued development of Thunder. If you'd like to show some appreciation, [here is a post with details on how to donate](https://github.com/thunder-app/thunder/issues/756) to the active contributors of Thunder.\r\n\r\nA quick reminder: if you are using the Google Play version or App Store version, please note that it may take a bit of time before you receive the update. Now onto the update notes. This update brings a few major features:\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf89 New Features\r\n- The comment creation page has been fully re-built from the ground up and introduces a few new features, including the ability to specify the comment language, ability to comment as a different user, and addition of spoilers to the markdown toolbar. If you have any suggestions or feedback regarding these changes, feel free to make a new issue on GitHub!\r\n- There is now initial support for video playback on Thunder! The built-in video player should work with most video URLs (that end in a proper video extension) and should work with YouTube URLs. Additionally, you can customize some video settings such as playback speed, auto-mute, auto-play and more in the Settings page. The video player is still experimental, so there may still be some issues present.\r\n- Additional customization options including the ability to customize the colours of actions (upvotes, downvotes, saving, etc.), hiding thumbnails from the feed, showing user/community avatars, and much more.\r\n\r\n\u2139 General\r\n- There have been improvements to the overall UI/UX across the board. This includes improvements to the pure black theme, improvements to markdown rendering of tables, quotes, and more.\r\n- There have also been a lot of changes under-the-hood to hopefully improve the overall performance and reliability of actions. As a result of these changes, there may still be some issues that were not caught during testing. If you notice any general issues, please make a new issue on GitHub.\r\n\r\nAnd much much more. I can't go through all the changes in the changelog, but for those who are curious, feel free to check out the full changelog below.\r\n\r\nWe have a Matrix space if you would like to join in on

Spoiler markdown detection has been improved, and there is now initial/experimental support for subscript and superscript markdown tags.

This is accessible through Settings -> Appearance -> Theming.

                    "localizedDescription": "Hey everyone, it's time for yet another Thunder release. As always, there have been many improvements, additions, changes and fixes in this release which should make for a even better Thunder experience. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to discuss it in the Thunder community or on GitHub.\r\n\r\nA quick reminder: if you are using the Google Play version or App Store version, please note that it may take a bit of time before you receive the update. Now onto the update notes. This update brings a few major features:\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf89 New Features\r\n\r\n- Initial support for moderator actions. Thunder has added support for some moderator actions such as locking, pinning, and removing posts. To access these actions, simply long-press on a post and select \"Moderator Actions\" from the menu. Additional moderator actions such as mod logs, and reports will come in a future update.\r\n- Support for high-refresh rate devices. Thunder should now feel smoother on Android devices with high-refresh rate displays, and should no longer be limited to 60 Hz. For iOS, Thunder also supports ProMotion devices.\r\n- Customizable post metadata. You can now customize the post metadata information (vote counts, comment counts, etc) on your feed! This can be done in **Settings -> Appearance -> Compact/Card View Settings**. Simply drag and drop the metadata information you want to see on your feed. The order of the information will be the order that you drag it into the preview.\r\n- Experimental local push notification support on Android. Thunder has experimental support for handling push notifications locally on Android devices. When enabled, Thunder will attempt to fetch new notifications in the background while the app is not running. Please note that this feature is highly dependent on the Android OS and their battery saving settings\r\n\r\n\u2139 General\r\n- Additional UI/UX and quality-of-life improvements. This includes but is not limited to:\r\n  - Support for spoiler markdown tags. Spoiler tags will be automatically minimized, and can be expanded when tapping on them\r\n  - Support for creating cross posts for an existing post, and deleting existing posts\r\n  - Addition of more options including hiding top app bar, medium font scale option, and colorized usernames\r\n- Added new condensed post body view to the post page which shows a smaller preview of images and thumbnails\r\n- Added the ability to search posts/comments directly from community feed\r\n\r\nAnd much much more.

                    "localizedDescription": "Hey everyone! You guessed it, its time for yet another Thunder release. As always, there have been many improvements, additions, changes and fixes in this release which should make for a even better Thunder experience. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to discuss it in the Thunder community or on GitHub.\r\n\r\nA quick reminder: if you are using the Google Play version or App Store version, please note that it may take a bit of time before you receive the update. Now onto the update notes. This update brings a few major features:\r\n\r\n\u2139 **General**\r\n- Lemmy 0.19.x support is now partially supported on Thunder (see known issues below). This will hopefully allow for a smooth transition experience once the official Lemmy 0.19.x update is released. This also means that instance blocking and the new sort types are available to use for instances running on 0.19.x.\r\n- More language localizations. Thanks to the community, there have been a ton of localization done on Thunder. This includes initial support for Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l, Spanish, Polish, Ukrainian, Finnish, and Swedish. If you want to contribute towards additional languages, feel free to reach out!\r\n- Overall UI and UX improvements across the board including post title suggestions when creating a new post with an external URL, post and comment actions on long-press menu, trending communities on the Search page, and so much more.\r\n\r\n\u2699\ufe0f\u00a0**Performance**\r\n- The feed page has been reworked from the ground up to provide you with a smoother and hopefully more seamless experience. This is a more under-the-hood change so you may not notice much change to the visuals.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf89 **Features**\r\n- Anonymous profiles are now available. This allows you to add an instance and browse that instance without having to create an account or log in. To do this, simply tap on \"Add Anonymous Instance\" on the profile selection page and enter in the instance of your choice.\r\n- The search page has now been revamped to include even more options, including users, posts, comments, and links. Additionally, you can adjust the sort type and the feed type to better narrow your search results.\r\n- New sharing options for posts. When sharing posts, you now have the ability to customize what you want to share. You can share the link, the media, title, and so much more.\r\n- For Android users, you can now set Thunder to open links by default. To do this, go to Settings -> General -> Links and select the URLs you want to open with Thunder.\r\n\r\nAnd much much more. I can't go through all the changes in the changelog, but for those who are curious, feel free to check out the full changelog below.\r\n\r\nWe have a Matrix space if you would like to join in on discussions: https://matrix.to/#/#thunderapp:matrix.org\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Known Issues**\r\n\r\nThere are some known issues with this update that I\u2019m already aware about. Theses issues were found after submitting the build to the Play Store/App Store. I\u2019m currently working on these issues and fixes should be coming in another update sometime soon.\r\n\r\n- Some markdown links are being parsed incorrectly. This results in some links not showing up properly, or some links showing duplicate text.\r\n- Lemmy 0.19.x support is currently only available up to 0.19.0-rc.4. There have been some more changes since then which are being addressed.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n## Additions\r\n* Added ability to add anonymous instance accounts by @micahmo in

This release has a lot of minor tweaks and improvements to the overall Thunder experience.\r\n\r\nA reminder for anyone who didn\u2019t catch the previous announcement, Thunder is now officially available on Google Play! You should also be able to search up Thunder on the Play Store to find it. For more details about the launch, see this post: https://lemmy.world/post/1631968\r\n\r\nIf you are using the Google Play version or TestFlight, please note that it may take a bit of time before you receive the update.

This update brings a few major features:\r\n\r\n- You can now select custom accent colours! This will allow you to choose a splash of colour which will be applied consistently across the whole app. Please note that Material You has to be disabled for the accent colours to be applied properly\r\n- You can now customize the look of the comment indicators. There are different options to choose from to suit your personal preferences\r\n- There are even more settings for you to customize. You can hide the FABs, hide NSFW posts, show community icons and authors on posts, and even more!\r\n- Improvements to link previews. With this, you should be seeing more link previews and it should create a more consistent experience\r\n- You can now manage blocked communities and users. Simply go to your profile, and there should be a gear icon for you to remove any blocked communities and users.\r\n- You can now access user and community sidebars. If you visit a community, or a user, you can tap in the info icon to bring up a sidebar filled with all the information you could possible want\r\n- Overall improvements to performance. This update should feel smoother and there should hopefully be less stuttering happening overall\r\n- Finally, there has been some under-the-hood changes to allow for localization and translations for the future. Look forward to this in a future update!\r\n\r\nWe have a Matrix space if you would like to join in on discussions: https://matrix.to/#/#thunderapp:matrix.org\r\n\r\nIf you find any issues or would like to suggest features, please open up a new issue!

You should feel that scrolling through the feed is smoother, and less laggy (hopefully) There is still an issue with some stuttering within long comment threads which will be looked at further\r\n- Added ability to edit your own comments - editing will replace the reply swipe gesture if you are swiping on your own comment\r\n- Added ability to download images - contribution from @MrAntonS\r\n- Added back ability to collapse a comment, toggle-able in the settings\r\n- Added pull to refresh on posts\r\n- An additional button now shows up for each post in comfortable view to open the more actions modal\r\n- Long pressing the post will bring up a modal to perform more actions such as visit community, user profile, sharing\r\n- Added initial support for viewing user profiles - including their posts and comments\r\n- Added top sort options - contribution from @JulianPaulus\r\n- Upvoting and downvoting posts/comments now provides you with immediate feedback (no more waiting around)\r\n\r\n### QoL Improvements\r\n- Adjusted thickness of divider between posts to help differentiate posts\r\n- Increased threshold for triggering a upvote/downvote on comments to hopefully have less accidental actions\r\n\r\n### Fixes and Misc\r\n- Fixed issue where you could not exit app when swiping back or using the back button\r\n- Fixed issue where an error would be thrown if trying to access http pages - contribution from @vbh\r\n- Fixed issue with missing haptic feedback on comment actions and other places\r\n- Fixed issue where reply button would cover actions and comments for short posts\r\n- Removed mark as read for mentions and replies that have already been read\r\n- Dockerfile for building Android builds - contribution from @Fmstrat \r\n- Fixing settings not reachable - contribution from @ggichure  \r\n\r\nAnd many more changes under the hood!\r\n\r\nThe main focuses for the next release are (but subject to change):\r\n- Adding in a way to block users or communities\r\n- Editing of posts\r\n- Adding more options when creating posts\r\n- Alternate ways of voting in comments outside of swipe gestures\r\n\r\n----\r\nIf you find any issues or would like to suggest features, please open up a new issue!

Theres another update incoming \ud83c\udf89 \r\n\r\n**Important: it is highly highly recommended to reinstall the app for the best (and least buggy) experience possible**\r\n\r\nThis update includes some major things under the hood to allow Thunder's functionality to work even better  and smoother than before. These under the hood changes will make it easier to implement further features in the future, so get excited for that. There's mainly a lot of quality of life changes, and features that have been suggested by the community many times!\r\n\r\nAs always, this is an alpha release, so do expect bugs to pop up here and there. Without further ado, here are the changes:\r\n\r\n### Major Additions\r\n- The underlying lemmy API has been migrated to use lemmy_api_client (the same one that Liftoff uses!). This is to allow for faster development of features, and to hopefully make one unified dart lemmy api client\r\n- The underlying lemmy API change is a large change, so there may be some bugs that come from that migration. If you notice any issues that were not previously there, make sure to create a GitHub issue for it so that it can be fixed ASAP\r\n- Addition of adaptive icons for Android. This will hopefully make Thunder stick out less like a sore thumb on Android devices - contribution from @coslu\r\n- There is a new icon for inbox mentions and replies to mark them as \"read\"\r\n- Added default sort, and feed types to Settings - contribution from @JulianPaulus\r\n- Added Material You themes for Android users! For iOS users, there will be a feature in the future to allow you to select from a list of pre-made themes/colours\r\n- You can now swipe across the bottom navigation bar to bring up the side menu on the feed page - no more having to press the hamburger icon on the top left\r\n\r\n### QoL Improvements\r\n- Settings has been re-organized to make it easier to find what you're looking for\r\n- Adjusted the \"mail\" icon in the inbox to be more descriptive of what it does\r\n- Adjusted some internal logic for fetching and caching images to bring better performance and less stuttering when scrolling through large amounts of images\r\n- Adjusted the slide-to-dismiss image feature to be handled a bit better overall\r\n- Tapping on a comment will now only collapse/hide the replies, and not the comment itself - contribution from @vbh\r\n- Initial work on marking posts as read - when you tap on a post, it will be marked as read and the title/description will be greyed out to indicate that status\r\n- There is now a setting to allow you to move the thumbnail icons to the right side\r\n- There is now a setting to allow automatic light/dark mode depending on system settings\r\n- Added an option in settings to open up all links in an external browser by default, without using the in-app browser\r\n- Added ability to tap in on images within posts and comments\r\n- Added a setting to disable swipe gestures on posts for those who prefer to not use them\r\n\r\n### Fixes and Misc\r\n- Fixed issue with the sort type not being respected when refreshing a feed, or switching communities\r\n- Fixed an issue where the comment upvote/downvote would not render properly\r\n- Fixed an issue where the bottom navigation bar was black on Android devices\r\n- Fixed an issue where Thunder would redirect you back to the feed page after pressing back in the Settings\r\n- Fixed an issue where posts would only show a single image even if it contained multiple\r\n\r\nAnd many more changes under the hood! Have a thunderous day :D\r\n\r\nIf you have gotten this far down, these are the general major plans for the next release (this could change, so its not a definitive list):\r\n- Introduction of user profiles to allow you to see the posts, and perhaps other information for a given user. This also would include your own profile as well, to be able to see the posts you've created, anything you've saved, comments, etc\r\n- Marking more things as read, and being able to filter out any posts that you have already seen\r\n- Editing of posts and comments\r\n- Better and more options for posting\r\n- Media download for images\r\n- Initial support for blocking communities (maybe)\r\n\r\n----\r\nIf you find any issues or would like to suggest features, please open up a new issue!

As always, this is an alpha release, so do expect bugs to pop up here and there. Without further ado, here are the changes:\r\n\r\n_If you encounter any issues, it is highly recommended to **reinstall the app if possible** for the best (and hopefully less buggy) experience_\r\n\r\n### Major Features\r\n- There is now a new tab which shows you your inbox including mentions, replies, and private messages\r\n  - Note: The inbox features do not automatically refresh when you're actively in the app. Relaunching the app, or navigating to the inbox will trigger a refresh of the information! Automatic refresh will happen in a future release \r\n  - This is an entirely new feature, so there is only basic functionality at the moment - more features to come in a future release\r\n  - You can toggle between showing all messages, or just unread messages\r\n  - You can reply to mentions and replies. Replying to private messages is not available in this release\r\n  - Tapping on a mention or a reply will open up the corresponding post\r\n- External links now have more options! You can reload the page, open the link in an external browser, or share the link using your system's share dialog\r\n- Improved accessibility labels for those using Talkback on Android or VoiceOver on iOS\r\n- New compact post view, along with swipe gestures for posts to allow voting, and saving (replying directly by swiping on a post is not yet implemented)\r\n- Improved image previews - you can now swipe down to dismiss an image\r\n- New OLED black theme toggle in the settings, giving you even more darkness\r\n- New about page within settings for links to GitHub and the lemmy community\r\n\r\n### QoL Improvements\r\n- When in the post page, you now have extra options to reply and share the given post using your system's share dialog\r\n- The FAB reply button now automatically hides when you are at the end of the comments to allow you to see the contents of those comments\r\n- Improved GIF support - contribution from @MrAntonS \r\n- Whitespace trimming for instances, in case you accidentally add an extra space at the beginning or end of the instance name\r\n- When selecting an account from the profile page, the current account will now be highlighted\r\n- Search now sorts by Active rather than the default provided by lemmy - contribution from @Benjamint22 \r\n\r\n### Fixes and Misc\r\n- Some fixes when creating new posts or comments, where the scrolling would behave in weird ways\r\n- Fixed an issue where users were having issues logging on when trying to log in with passwords > 60 characters long\r\n- Adjusted limit of subscriptions to fetch to be 50 for the meantime to fix some issues with subscriptions not showing on the sidebar\r\n\r\nAnd many more changes under the hood!\r\n\r\n----\r\nIf you find any issues or would like to suggest features, please open up a new issue!

This update includes a few major things, including the ability to create posts, and comments at a basic level! In addition to that, theres been a few more tweaks and quality of life changes. As always, this is an alpha release, so do expect bugs to pop up here and there. Without further ado, here are the changes:\r\n\r\n### Note on version releases:\r\nNow that Thunder is also released on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/9n8xrqvH), the naming conventions for version releases will be changed to keep both iOS and Android versions on the same format. The new format will be v0.2.1-x where x indicates the build version (e.g., v0.2.1+5, v0.2.1+6, ...)\r\n- The reasoning for this is that versioning on Apple only allows for numerical values (and such, `-alpha` is ignored on iOS devices but not on Android devices)\r\n- The second reasoning is to allow for faster releases sooner on TestFlight, without needing to submit a new version to be reviewed every time which hinders the release cycle. Hopefully this makes sense, and let me know if you have any feedback regarding this change.\r\n\r\n_If you encounter any issues, it is highly recommended to **reinstall the app if possible** for the best (and hopefully less buggy) experience_\r\n\r\n### Major Features\r\n- You can now create posts when you are viewing a specific community. This is a new feature, so you may experience some bugs. Feedback is always appreciated to improve the experience!\r\n- You can also now reply directly to a post, or reply to a specific comment. To reply to a specific comment, you need to swipe left on a comment to bring up the modal\r\n- NSFW blur has been included in this release thanks to the contribution from @guigs4!\r\n- Tapping on a community link in a post or comment should now redirect you to that community within the app - no more browser opening to view that community that someone linked in a post/comment\r\n- Sentry was added in the last release to allow for automatic error reporting when something happens.\r\n  - This is now an opt-in feature. When you first start up the app, a notification will ask you whether or not you want to enable Sentry error reporting. You can always opt-out or opt back in if you choose in the Settings\r\n\r\n### QoL Improvements\r\n- Added a settings option to enable or disable to in-app update notification\r\n- Added the instance name to various parts of the app to distinguish communities across instances\r\n- When visiting a community, you can now see some basic information about the community, including the instance, number of subscribers, and number of people online\r\n- Searching is improved to show you even more results for communities\r\n- Improvements to logging in experience, removing extra spaces or lines from the username/password fields - contribution from @MrAntonS \r\n\r\n### Fixes and Misc\r\n- Fixed issue where settings would not be respected after an app relaunch\r\n- Fixed an issue with link previews not showing up properly\r\n- Added fastlane config for Android - contribution from @IzzySoft\r\n\r\nAnd many more changes under the hood!\r\n\r\n----\r\nIf you find any issues or would like to suggest features, please open up a new issue!

Although it's still in the early stages, it has gained a lot of traction over the past few days and it has been incredible to see the community engaged in discussions, and suggesting ideas for future releases. For those who are unaware, there is an official lemmy community here: https://lemmy.world/c/thunder_app\r\n\r\nSince the last update, there have been a lot of changes (both under the hood, and also new features) which I will be releasing as a new alpha version here. As always, this is an alpha release, so do expect bugs to pop up here and there. Without further ado, here are the changes:\r\n\r\n_As there are a lot of under-the-hood changes, it is highly recommended to **reinstall the app if possible** for the best (and hopefully less buggy) experience_\r\n\r\n### Major Features\r\n- Comments can now be voted on, and saved through swipe gestures (similar to Apollo for those who have used it in the past)\r\n  - **Note**: feedback on actions (voting/saving) for comments and posts may have a slight delay depending on the instance's responsiveness (e.g., it may take a few seconds for the action to update)\r\n- There is now support for multiple account logins, and the ability to switch between the accounts\r\n  - In the account page, there is a button on the top right that will allow you to add more accounts, or switch between accounts \r\n- Theres a new option which allows you to toggle between dark/light themes from the Settings page\r\n- There is now an in-app notification which will alert you whenever there is a new release on GitHub (yet to be fully tested)\r\n\r\n### QoL Improvements\r\n- You can tap on a community's name in the feed, or when you're inside a post to see the community's feed\r\n- When viewing a community, you can quickly subscribe or unsubscribe from that community\r\n- Tapping on an image in the feed or within a post should bring up a fullscreen image for you to zoom in/out\r\n- When you are not logged in, the voting actions on posts and comments will be hidden from view\r\n- When logging into your account, you should now be able to use your system's password manager to fill out the username and password fields\r\n- Some haptic feedback has been added for actions!\r\n\r\n### Fixes and Misc\r\n- Theres now a splash screen on app startup - no more glaring white page when you load the app!\r\n- Fixed a bug where refreshing a feed or selecting a sort option would send you back to the Local feed\r\n\r\nAnd many more changes under the hood!\r\n\r\n----\r\nPlease note that iOS users will need to install the ipa through AltStore as there is no TestFlight set up at this point.\r\n\r\nIf you find any issues or would like to suggest features, please open up a new issue!

It is also accessible through the \"Virtual Machine\" menu.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed sending simultaneous mouse button presses (#7068)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Add `version` command to detect current UTM version\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New option to disable key swapping on ISO keyboards (#6976)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New option to randomize network MAC addresses on clone (#7035)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.1)\r\n* New Liquid Glass icon thanks to @forcequitOS\r\n* Added App Intents for VM operations (#6245)\r\n* Added UEFI boot support for RISC-V64 and LoongArch64. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* QEMU PPC: Disable `bootindex` when `boot-device` is used in prom-env. This allows Yellow Dog Linux for PPC to work out of the box. (#6436)\r\n* QEMU x86_64: Fixed floppy boot order configuration for other PC models (isapc, i440fx) (#7166)\r\n* QEMU PPC/M68K: Includes classicvirtio drivers to support cursor input without capture and directory sharing (#6520)\r\n* QEMU M68K: Fixed virtio drive config (#7008)\r\n* Fixed a rare crash after stopping VM due to a race condition in libusb\r\n* Home: improve screenshot contrast in Dark Mode (#6894)\r\n* Config: Fixed a crash when trying to enter a large size value when creating a new drive (#7295)\r\n* Config: Corrected the default host IP address in port forwarding config to \"0.0.0.0\" when it incorrectly displayed \"127.0.0.1\" (#7132)\r\n* Keyboard Shortcuts: Create custom combinations of keyboard shortcuts from either Settings -> Input or via the Keyboard icon in the VM (press and hold on iOS/visionOS). This will allow you to easily send key commands such as Ctrl+Alt+Del or Stop+A to the VM. (#5698, #6310, #6757)\r\n* Wizard: New option to import an existing drive image when setting up a Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: New option to create a serial port only Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: Removed VHDX import option because Microsoft now provides ARM64 ISO images. Note: You can still create manually import an VHDX after creating a new VM.\r\n* Wizard: New template to create classic Mac OS VMs for M68K and PPC (#3504, #6890)\r\n* Wizard: Most common and supported machines for emulation are now listed prominently with the full list of supported QEMU architectures/targets hidden behind an \"Expert\" mode. This is necessary because most of the QEMU targets are not properly supported by the wizard anyways and does not generate a bootable config. They usually require a lot more manual tinkering. The page order of the wizard is also tweaked so the hardware config comes before the boot config now.\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when launching ArchLinux due to mis-handling of REV32\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when the first instruction executed is a goto\r\n* (iOS SE) Removed ARM32, RISC-V32, and added M68K. There is little use for ARM32 and RISC-V32 as they cannot boot anything useful that cannot also be booted by the 64-bit variant (which is still included). If you have a counter example of this, please open an issue on GitHub and we can consider re-adding it back in the future. However, removing these will make the app size a lot smaller. M68K is added to support classic Mac OS.\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed guest tools mounting (#7297)\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed stop button not working (#7298)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a bug where an error message on startup leads to the window being stuck (#7161)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable file locking so VMs can be launched from a network share or a filesystem that does not support locking (#7211)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable screenshots completely for privacy reasons (#6620)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to swap Ctrl and Cmd keys in VMs (#4003)\r\n* (macOS 26) Settings: Brand new layout with a sidebar to match other native apps\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Added clearer message when trying to install macOS beta without having the latest beta support tools installed\r\n* (macOS) AVF: New option to resize (expand) disk images (#6891)\r\n* (macOS 26) Fixed a layout issue with the resize image popover\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed hide sidebar button\r\n* (macOS) Config: Show localized network adapter names when available (#7287) (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed an issue where wrong UUIDs were generated for display configs (#7145)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.0)\r\n* Updated to QEMU v10.0.2\r\n* Config: In the RAM slider, the maximum value has been increased to 64GiB (note that you can always go above the slider limit by typing in the text box) (#7234)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed crash when VM name is empty (#7245)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Refactored toolbar button layout code\r\n* (macOS) Host only networks: you can set up multiple host-only networks (including ones shared by VMware) and have multiple VMs on the same virtual network (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: added option to boot Apple VMs into recovery mode (thanks @cees-elzinga)\r\n* (macOS) ~~Enable QEMU support for vmapple (#7150)~~ Machine model is removed for stability reasons but `apple-gfx-pci` is still supported for Intel VMs\r\n* (macOS) Rename the main window to 'UTM Library' (#7264)\r\n* (macOS) Display an error when IPSW install fails to load the file (instead of crashing) (#6855)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: Fixed a layout issue (#7117)\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization: Add support for ASIF drive images.

(#6436)\r\n* QEMU x86_64: Fixed floppy boot order configuration for other PC models (isapc, i440fx) (#7166)\r\n* QEMU PPC/M68K: Includes classicvirtio drivers to support cursor input without capture and directory sharing (#6520)\r\n* QEMU M68K: Fixed virtio drive config (#7008)\r\n* Fixed a rare crash after stopping VM due to a race condition in libusb\r\n* Home: improve screenshot contrast in Dark Mode (#6894)\r\n* Config: Fixed a crash when trying to enter a large size value when creating a new drive (#7295)\r\n* Config: Corrected the default host IP address in port forwarding config to \"0.0.0.0\" when it incorrectly displayed \"127.0.0.1\" (#7132)\r\n* Keyboard Shortcuts: Create custom combinations of keyboard shortcuts from either Settings -> Input or via the Keyboard icon in the VM (press and hold on iOS/visionOS). This will allow you to easily send key commands such as Ctrl+Alt+Del or Stop+A to the VM. (#5698, #6310, #6757)\r\n* Wizard: New option to import an existing drive image when setting up a Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: New option to create a serial port only Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: Removed VHDX import option because Microsoft now provides ARM64 ISO images. Note: You can still create manually import an VHDX after creating a new VM.\r\n* Wizard: New template to create classic Mac OS VMs for M68K and PPC (#3504, #6890)\r\n* Wizard: Most common and supported machines for emulation are now listed prominently with the full list of supported QEMU architectures/targets hidden behind an \"Expert\" mode. This is necessary because most of the QEMU targets are not properly supported by the wizard anyways and does not generate a bootable config. They usually require a lot more manual tinkering. The page order of the wizard is also tweaked so the hardware config comes before the boot config now.\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when launching ArchLinux due to mis-handling of REV32\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when the first instruction executed is a goto\r\n* (iOS SE) Removed ARM32, RISC-V32, and added M68K. There is little use for ARM32 and RISC-V32 as they cannot boot anything useful that cannot also be booted by the 64-bit variant (which is still included). If you have a counter example of this, please open an issue on GitHub and we can consider re-adding it back in the future. However, removing these will make the app size a lot smaller. M68K is added to support classic Mac OS.\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed guest tools mounting (#7297)\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed stop button not working (#7298)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a bug where an error message on startup leads to the window being stuck (#7161)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable file locking so VMs can be launched from a network share or a filesystem that does not support locking (#7211)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable screenshots completely for privacy reasons (#6620)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to swap Ctrl and Cmd keys in VMs (#4003)\r\n* (macOS 26) Settings: Brand new layout with a sidebar to match other native apps\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Added clearer message when trying to install macOS beta without having the latest beta support tools installed\r\n* (macOS) AVF: New option to resize (expand) disk images (#6891)\r\n* (macOS 26) Fixed a layout issue with the resize image popover\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed hide sidebar button\r\n* (macOS) Config: Show localized network adapter names when available (#7287) (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed an issue where wrong UUIDs were generated for display configs (#7145)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.0)\r\n* Updated to QEMU v10.0.2\r\n* Config: In the RAM slider, the maximum value has been increased to 64GiB (note that you can always go above the slider limit by typing in the text box) (#7234)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed crash when VM name is empty (#7245)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Refactored toolbar button layout code\r\n* (macOS) Host only networks: you can set up multiple host-only networks (including ones shared by VMware) and have multiple VMs on the same virtual network (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: added option to boot Apple VMs into recovery mode (thanks @cees-elzinga)\r\n* (macOS) ~~Enable QEMU support for vmapple (#7150)~~ Machine model is removed for stability reasons but `apple-gfx-pci` is still supported for Intel VMs\r\n* (macOS) Rename the main window to 'UTM Library' (#7264)\r\n* (macOS) Display an error when IPSW install fails to load the file (instead of crashing) (#6855)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: Fixed a layout issue (#7117)\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization: Add support for ASIF drive images.

This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* v4.6.5 reverted a change from v4.6.4 due to reports of crashes and kernel panics on some machines. As a result, there will be issues when upgrading to Windows 11 24H2 where the screen will go black.

When TSO is enabled on a guest operating system that is aware of the system register (i.e. Rosetta for Linux), performance of Intel emulation within the guest can be greatly improved. Note that if the guest kernel supports dynamically toggling TSO, you do not need to enable this.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Improved macOS guest support** The last window size (including full screen size) will be restored when the guest supports dynamic resolution. Removable drives and shared directories can now be ejected and changed while the macOS VM is running. Copy/paste synchronization between macOS 15 guest and host now works when the guest tools are installed (from the CD icon in the toolbar).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue with macOS 15.0 and 15.0.1 where accesses to files will fail due to a permission error. This issue has been resolved with macOS 15.1.\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue on M4 series of Macs where virtualization fails for macOS guests older than 13.4. The issue should be addressed by Apple in a future update.

We recommend not upgrading to 24H2 for existing installs and 23H2 for new installs. If you have already upgraded, please follow the workaround described in the linked issue.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* The update to QEMU v9.1.2 will likely introduce other issues and regressions. If you experience any problem (crashes, performance, errors) that was not evident in v4.5.x, please [open an issue](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and provide all the requested information.

                    "localizedDescription": "**macOS Users:** there is no difference between v4.4.4 and v4.4.5. You do not need to update. \r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **macOS Sonoma support** New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore support for newer iOS** With the release of [TrollStore 2](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), this update brings JIT support for all iOS device that can run TrollStore. If (and only if) you are on at most iOS 16.3.1 AND your device is M1, M2, or A16, then you can also use the virtualization option. No other device or higher iOS version will likely ever be supported due to Apple [removing Hypervisor in iOS 16.4](http://twitter.com/utmapp/status/1708907045314035986). The only way around this is if Apple un-deletes the code (unlikely) or a jailbreak powerful enough to run a custom kernel is released (even more unlikely as this has never been done on a modern iOS device).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.5)\r\n* Fixed a \"device not found\" error when starting a VM with an empty interface (#5845)\r\n* Fixed JIT for TrollStore builds (#5216) (thanks @crstestacc)\r\n* Added support for virtualization on iOS 16.3.1 and lower (M1, M2, A16 only) (thanks @xliuxu)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed keyboard device not showing up on older macOS guests (#5814)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.3)\r\n* Guest Tools: supports caching the latest version and will only re-download when a newer version is available (#5692)\r\n* Fixed a bug where a suspended QEMU VM with a locked CD drive will refuse to resume\r\n* Localization: Updated Russian (thanks @s0rd3s)\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed display scaling sometimes not applying\r\n* (visionOS) Reimplemented multiple-window support with newer APIs and fixes an issue where the main window is resized on startup to the last VM display size\r\n* (visionOS) Process gaze touch events as indirect input\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard button was not opening the keyboard and sometimes causes the keyboard to keep popping up after being

If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed keyboard device not showing up on older macOS guests (#5814)\r\n\r\n## Changes

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n* If you suspended an Apple Virtualization VM in v4.4 and then downgrade to v4.3, you will not be able to resume the VM or start it at all. Please make sure you shut down any such VMs before downgrading or you may suffer data loss.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices. However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.\r\n* Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.\r\n* Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)\r\n* Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved\r\n* Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)\r\n* Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)\r\n* Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters\r\n* Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation\r\n* Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.\r\n* Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release\r\n* Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically. This addresses an error that shows up if the Documents directory does not get created properly by macOS.

Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings. (#5358)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @studio1a9)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when AVM window is closed (#5347)\r\n* (macOS) New option \u201cAutomatic\u201d for bridged network connection which will use the bridge the first active connection on the host.

                    "localizedDescription": "This version is broken due to a bug which prevents VMs from starting. Please update UTM to the latest version. If you obtained UTM from the Mac App Store, you may need to open the [App Store](itms-apps://apps.apple.com/updates) to the Updates tab to see it.\r\n\r\n## Highlights (Original)\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v8.0.2**\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nOn i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE.

Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.5)\r\n* Reverted ANGLE to an older version which includes the fix detailed in v4.2.4 but also does not break the Metal backend (#5238)\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj, @mavethee)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the pointer device stopped working on macOS Monterey guests (#5237)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Added option to use emulated trackpad (requires macOS Ventura guest)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`. You should now use similar properties in the `configuration` record\r\n* (macOS) Support changing the audio backend to CoreAudio and make CoreAudio the default (due to better latency and as a workaround to some crashes) (#5125)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.1)\r\n* QEMU: Support more than 8 cores for ARM64 targets (#4847)\r\n* Synchronize time on resume when QEMU guest agent is installed which should fix clock drift issues (#3218)\r\n* (iOS SE) Updated TCTI to latest branch from @ktemkin which has support for vector instructions (#4865)\r\n* (macOS) Switch to emulated trackpad when guest+host are macOS 13+ (second attempt for #4636 and #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the \"raw image\" checkbox when creating a new drive (#5100)\r\n* (macOS) Add PC speaker sound device as an option. You can now add a second sound device on supported targets (x86_64/i386 PC based targets) and set the hardware to PC Speaker to emulate older motherboard speakers.\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: new verbs \"open file\", \"execute\", and \"query ip\" which uses the QEMU guest agent to send commands to the guest. Use the Apple Script Editor's Open Dictionary tool for more information.\r\n* (macOS) CLI: new commands \"file push\", \"file pull\", \"exec\", and \"ip-address\". See `utmctl help` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.0)\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest (27/02/2023) commit\r\n* Automatically revert CPU to \"default\" if model is missing due to updated QEMU (#4910)\r\n* ~~Remove virtio-bus devices (they didn't work) (#4893)~~\r\n* Support drag and drop to import an .utm package (#3599)\r\n* Support copying sparse images across different volumes (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed tearing/performance issue for non-GL accelerated displays when under graphics load (#5049)\r\n* Fixed error when importing a new drive with the same name as an existing drive (#5052)\r\n* ~~Fixed a crash on startup when multiple audio devices are plugged in (#4629)~~\r\n* Wizard: Generate a working configuration for isapc (#4961)\r\n* Settings: Use pretty labels for CPU flags (#4940)\r\n* Translation: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Translation: added Czech readme (thanks @stinovlasmp)\r\n* Translation: updated German (thanks @LostInCompilation and @afh)\r\n* (macOS) Capture Mouse has been renamed to Capture Input and now will show the current capture status as a toggle button\r\n* (macOS) Apple VMs (macOS guests) now support Capture Input which will capture the system keys. This used to be always on as the default. It is now off by default and the toggle button will enable it.

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* (iOS SE) **TCTI backend updates**. Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`. You should now use similar properties in the `configuration` record\r\n* (macOS) Support changing the audio backend to CoreAudio and make CoreAudio the default (due to better latency and as a workaround to some crashes) (#5125)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.1)\r\n* QEMU: Support more than 8 cores for ARM64 targets (#4847)\r\n* Synchronize time on resume when QEMU guest agent is installed which should fix clock drift issues (#3218)\r\n* (iOS SE) Updated TCTI to latest branch from @ktemkin which has support for vector instructions (#4865)\r\n* (macOS) Switch to emulated trackpad when guest+host are macOS 13+ (second attempt for #4636 and #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the \"raw image\" checkbox when creating a new drive (#5100)\r\n* (macOS) Add PC speaker sound device as an option. You can now add a second sound device on supported targets (x86_64/i386 PC based targets) and set the hardware to PC Speaker to emulate older motherboard speakers.\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: new verbs \"open file\", \"execute\", and \"query ip\" which uses the QEMU guest agent to send commands to the guest. Use the Apple Script Editor's Open Dictionary tool for more information.\r\n* (macOS) CLI: new commands \"file push\", \"file pull\", \"exec\", and \"ip-address\". See `utmctl help` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.0)\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest (27/02/2023) commit\r\n* Automatically revert CPU to \"default\" if model is missing due to updated QEMU (#4910)\r\n* ~~Remove virtio-bus devices (they didn't work) (#4893)~~\r\n* Support drag and drop to import an .utm package (#3599)\r\n* Support copying sparse images across different volumes (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed tearing/performance issue for non-GL accelerated displays when under graphics load (#5049)\r\n* Fixed error when importing a new drive with the same name as an existing drive (#5052)\r\n* ~~Fixed a crash on startup when multiple audio devices are plugged in (#4629)~~\r\n* Wizard: Generate a working configuration for isapc (#4961)\r\n* Settings: Use pretty labels for CPU flags (#4940)\r\n* Translation: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Translation: added Czech readme (thanks @stinovlasmp)\r\n* Translation: updated German (thanks @LostInCompilation and @afh)\r\n* (macOS) Capture Mouse has been renamed to Capture Input and now will show the current capture status as a toggle button\r\n* (macOS) Apple VMs (macOS guests) now support Capture Input which will capture the system keys. This used to be always on as the default. It is now off by default and the toggle button will enable it.

                    "localizedDescription": "This is the same release as v4.1.5 but with the change to default enable GPU acceleration for Linux reverted. This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to `virtio-gpu-pci` or another card that does not have `-gl` in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* ~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.~~\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.6)\r\n* Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for \"Hardware OpenGL Acceleration\" which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.9)\r\n\r\n* Fixed some broken links to documentation (#4529)\r\n* Fixed an issue where running ARM64 emulation on ARM64 gives an error \"The \u2018host\u2019 CPU type can only be used with KVM or HVF\" (#4528)\r\n* Fixed a regression where S390x and SPARC VMs cannot start due to missing USB bus\r\n* (iOS) Fixed UTM SE cannot launch any VMs (#4516)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

                    "localizedDescription": "**Update [20/10/22]**: UTM SE build was removed and replaced with version v3.2.3 because of a bug that prevents any VM from starting up. If you have installed UTM SE v4.0.8, please re-install v3.2.3 or wait for the next update.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.\r\n* **Reclaiming space**: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.\r\n* **Disposable mode**: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select \"Run without saving changes\" to start VM in \"disposable mode.\" In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped.

Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.\r\n* **Reclaiming space**: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.\r\n* **Disposable mode**: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select \"Run without saving changes\" to start VM in \"disposable mode.\" In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped. (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* Reminder: for troubleshooting common Windows install issues (such as no networking), please check out the [guide](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/windows-10).\r\n* If you manually added `highmem=on` or `highmem=off` to your QEMU Machine Properties as a workaround to issues in a previous release, please remove it.\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.2.x will be the last update to support iOS 11-13.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.2.x. After that, iOS 14+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.3)\r\n* Disabled screenshots for GL virtual machines (workaround for a crash that occurs, this will be re-enabled in a future update once the crash is triaged)\r\n* (iOS) Pass through Esc key on external keyboard when VoiceOver is in use (#3940)\r\n* (macOS) Use correct scaling when HiDPI is enabled (#3968)\r\n* (macOS) Fix toolbar overlapping top of screen when \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar in full screen\" is unchecked in system preferences (#3919)\r\n* (macOS) When bridged networking is selected, default the interface to \"en0\" (#3945)\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: clarify that Linux kernel and initrd must be uncompressed if Apple Virtualization is used\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.2)\r\n* Add \"disposable mode\" (see highlights for more information) (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Do not enable UEFI for unsupported architectures (#3976)\r\n* Fix broken play button in sidebar (#3980)\r\n* Fix \"Error -1 while loading VM state\" on resume caused by usbredir (#3979)\r\n* Various UI tweaks and typo fixes (#3984)\r\n* Fixed pausing without saving state\r\n* Fixed showing warning prompt when VM is paused but not saved\r\n* (iOS) Detect if UTM is installed without AltStore and AltJIT will not attempt to be used.\r\n* (iOS) Reduced build size by 10% (thanks @Halo-Michael) (#3934)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference option to revert Caps Lock behaviour to pre 3.2.0 (#3974)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.1)\r\n* Fixed boot of RISC-V virt platform (thanks @wegank)\r\n* Remove `highmem=off` default property which is no longer needed on macOS 12.4+ and iOS 15.5+ (it will still be used on lower versions) (#3941, #3946)\r\n* Caps lock state will now be synchronized when mouse is captured (note that if mouse is captured before the guest OS has booted up, the state will be out of sync) (#3415)\r\n* Re-introduce option to disable auto-resolution when SPICE tools is installed (#3938)\r\n* When discarding unsaved settings, do not delete any disk image not created by UTM (#3587)\r\n* Fix downloading of UTM zip files when the URL does not end in \".zip\" (#3953)\r\n* (macOS) When importing a disk image, do not silently overwrite an existing image of the same name (#3866)\r\n* (macOS) Added option to reclaim unused space from disk image and to compress a disk image (macOS 12+ only)\r\n* (macOS) On the VM list, the start button will now change to a spinner when the VM is starting and will disappear when the VM has started. Also added the ability to start/show a VM by double-clicking on the list item (#3885)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.0)\r\n* Checkbox for \"Import VHDX Image\" in the wizard now works correctly again (#3760)\r\n* Fixed various crashes in SPICE webdavd share has been resolved thanks to updated backend (#3633)\r\n* Removed \"cache=writethrough\" argument from block devices since it was added to workaround an issue with VHDX images which we now convert to QCOW2\r\n* Added \"discard=unmap,detect-zeroes=unmap\" argument to block devices to reclaim unused space (#3460)\r\n* When \"do not save screenshot to disk\" is enabled, any existing screenshot will be deleted the next time the VM is started (#3936)\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU additional arguments where it sometimes would not appear after setting it (#3895)\r\n* Fixed RNG device not appearing in console mode even when enabled in the settings (#3790)\r\n* Added support for up to 5 additional mouse buttons (you may need to re-map them in the guest OS as they are automatically set to middle/up/down/side/extra) (#3906)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue in the legacy view where \"invalid identifier\" error may show up on a newly created VM (#3872)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when changing display settings while the VM window is open (but stopped) (#3925)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when trying to select \"Share...\" in context menu (#3915)\r\n* (macOS) Prevent allowing rapid clicking of pause/resume which may lead to VM corruption (#3629)\r\n* (macOS) Show progress indicator while VM is saving to prevent user from terminating the app early and cause corruption (#3752)\r\n* (macOS) Block unsupported Apple USB devices from being captured (#3759)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n* iOS 14 and below: There is a known issue crashing while running under taurine but not unc0ver.

See notes below for some limitations.\r\n* Wizard redesign (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories\r\n* Overhaul of the UTM backend which should improve application stability\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n* You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting \"Move...\" Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using \"File -> Import Virtual Machine...\" Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is *always* deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n* Default machine properties will now always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property `highmem=off` will be appended unless the user specifies `highmem=on` in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select `virt` in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with `highmem=off`. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires `highmem=off`. Advanced users can still specify `highmem=on` and it will not be overridden.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.5)\r\n* Fixed latest Linux kernel failing to boot (\u201cEFI stub: Exiting boot services and installing virtual address map...\u201d) (thanks @agraf for the fix) (#2682)\r\n* Fixed freezing during restart of a GL VM (#3746)\r\n* Clarified that clipboard sharing and auto resolution features are the same setting (#3748)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.4)\r\n* The changes to behaviour of \u201clegacy input\u201d introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak \u201cForce PS/2 Controller\u201d in the QEMU settings. (#3723)\r\n* The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)\r\n* \"Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines\" shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* (iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.3)\r\n* *Hotfix*: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed\r\n* Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.\r\n* The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)\r\n* Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding `virtualization=on` machine property (#3703)\r\n* Default machine properties will always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. (See notes above.)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1).

This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.\r\n* Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations\r\n* Show \"unavailable\" VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)\r\n* Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)\r\n* Rename \"import\" menu to \"open\" to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the \"open\" option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it\r\n* New context menu option \"New from template...\" can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)\r\n* Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in \"busy\" state\r\n* Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when \"legacy input\" is off. Renamed \"legacy input\" to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)\r\n* Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings\r\n* (iOS) Fixed launching on < iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)\r\n* (iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)\r\n* Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -> Tweaks).

Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1475606159428046854\r\n* **QEMU v6.2.0**: Updated QEMU backend to the latest release. Full changelog: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.2\r\n* (iOS 13+) **New toolbar**: The new toolbar is much more compact and friendly for smaller displays. It is also now movable and does not interfere with the iOS 15 multitasking button on the top center of the screen. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1407350167494443023\r\n* (macOS 12+, ARM64) **Virtualize macOS 12**: New integration with Apple's Virtualization.framework backend allows native hardware accelerated virtualization of macOS 12 (supporting both CPU and GPU virtualization). UTM can also download the latest macOS installer directly from Apple. (This is only supported on macOS 12+ running on an ARM64 Mac.)\r\n* (macOS 11+) **Virtualize Linux with Apple backend**: You now have the option to use Apple's Virtualization.framework to virtualize Linux. Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from `cortex-a72` to `default`. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the `cortex-a72` CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). `default` will use the `host` CPU model when virtualization is used and `cortex-a72` when emulation is used.\r\n* The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is **not** marked as \"GPU Supported\".\r\n* The cursor and resolution change issues on ARM64 Windows has been fixed in [SPICE tools 0.164.3][3]. If you are using an older version and experience such issues, please update to the latest SPICE tools.\r\n* If you manually added `virtualization=on` to your VM machine properties, you should remove it.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.4)\r\n* Introduced option to disable RNG device, which causes issues on FreeBSD (#3493)\r\n* Wizard: directory sharing is now enabled by default\r\n* Changed the default USB 3.0 controller from `qemu-xhci` to `nec-usb-xhci` which addresses an issue where the DVD drive disconnects randomly on Windows ARM64 and causes random errors during setup (#3194)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed save panel opening when you try to close the settings (#3494)\r\n* (macOS) Hide unsupported directory sharing options in macOS guests (#3496)\r\n* (macOS) Fix invert scrolling option (thanks @ktprograms) (#3497)\r\n* (macOS) Apple VM config files are now in plain-text (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* (macOS) Hide non-disk drives from the drives icon menu and properly describe the \"EFI Variables\" \"drive\" in settings\r\n* (macOS) Fixed suspend save state being broken in a previous update\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when a toolbar icon is hidden due to small window size and a toolbar option is selected from the menu\r\n* (macOS) The stop button in the main window will now stop the VM if it is started\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: Fix disabled button colour being the same as enabled buttons\r\n* (iOS) Moved the toolbar icon lower to not collide with the touch target for showing control center\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where settings are not shown if the context menu is used to open it (#3513)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.3)\r\n* Improvements to download UI (thanks @conath) (#3432)\r\n* Wizard: various improvements to creating Linux VMs (#3472)\r\n* (iOS) Add licensing text to app settings (#3236)\r\n* (macOS) DMG package now has a pretty icon and background (#3257)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference to terminate when all windows are closed (previously this was the default) (#3483)\r\n* (macOS) Fix custom icon for Apple VMs (#3477)\r\n* (macOS) Fix retina mode support for QEMU VMs (note that previously there was a global preference to enable retina mode that is now removed, per-VM setting should be used instead) (#3471)\r\n* (macOS) Remove QEMU VM setting for \"Fit to Screen\" as it was never implemented for macOS\r\n* ~~(macOS) Remove Apple VM setting for \"Retina (HiDPI) Mode\" as it was confusing and is not used for rendering (it just specifies the size of the virtual monitor)~~ This has been reverted in v3.0.4 and the Retina (HiDPI) Mode has been added back. A use for this feature is if you wish to take screenshots at specific resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.2)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed drive delete/move buttons not appearing on macOS 11 (#3461)\r\n* (macOS) Added missing network entitlement for bridged networking on Apple VMs\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: convert VHDX to QCOW2 when creating a Windows VM\r\n* (macOS) Any imported drive on an interface that is NOT floppy, pflash, or none will be converted to QCOW2.

Additionally, dynamic resolution (auto-change resolution when VM window is resized) and more fixed resolutions (matching all the screen resolutions of the latest Mac computers) were added to the driver. This requires you to download the latest SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ and run the installer again (or manually updating your GPU driver from the ISO if you know how).\r\n* In v2.4.0, newly created Q35 and PC machine (x86 and x86_64) defaulted to the `Skylake-Client` CPU model. Subsequently, it was discovered that the change caused performance regressions. v2.4.1 reverted the default CPU model to `Default` but if you created a new Q35/PC VM in v2.4.0, it is recommended that you manually change the CPU in System settings to `Default`.\r\n* Since v1.0.0, UTM used the RTL8139 network card as the default for Q35 VMs (x86 and x86_64) and Virt VMs (ARM64). There is a bug in the device implementation that causes the Windows driver to freeze the system and many users reported Windows Installer freezing as well as random freezes through normal use. In v2.4.0, we changed the default network card for Virt machines to `virtio-net-pci` and in v2.4.1, we changed the default network card for Q35 machines to E1000. However, this change only applies to newly created VMs, and any existing VMs may still suffer from the random freeze issues. It is recommended that you change your network card to `e1000` for Q35 machines and `virtio-net-pci` for Virt machines. Windows 7 and above should have the Intel E1000 network card drivers already installed, but the VirtIO Network card requires drivers in the SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ (if you previously installed this, you should have the drivers already on your system).\r\n* (macOS) Since v2.1.2, UTM provided an option (Cmd+,) to \"Use only performance cores by default\" which defaulted to off. When on, any VM which does not have a manually configured CPU count (> 0) will set the CPU count to the number of performance cores on the system. In v2.4.1, we have made this option on by default which means if you previously have not modified this option, then it will now be on. If you turned the option on, it should not change and if you turned the option on and later off again, it should still be off. The reason for this change was because users may not be aware of this option which can result in degraded performance when left off and we believe the default should reflect the best possible performance. Note that as before, if you manually set a VM's CPU count > 0, then this option does not change anything.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* (iOS) Integrated AltKit for automatically triggering AltJIT when installed with AltStore (1.5b2+) and AltServer (1.5b8+) (thanks @JoeMatt)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed sandbox issues (cannot select file) on jailbroken devices (thanks @Halo-Michael)\r\n* Improved zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Fixed inverted mouse cursor colour in Windows\r\n* New VMs will only use PCores by default (unless manually overridden with Preferences or per-VM config), this also fixes #3180\r\n* Changed default Q35 audio card to intel-hda\r\n* Changed default Q35 network card to E1000 and Virt network card to virtio-net (#3130)\r\n* Removed default CPU for Q35 and PC configurations because the Skylake-Client CPU resulted in performance regression (#3249)\r\n* Fixed downloadVM URL action when the ZIP name collides with the .utm name (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed a race condition leading to crash when a VM is shut down suddenly\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues",

You can configure it in the Network settings for your VM.\r\n* (macOS 11+ and iOS 13+) **GPU acceleration for OpenGL on Linux**. Use `virtio-ramfb-gl` or `virtio-vga-gl` display device and compatible Linux drivers (most modern Linux distros will have it already installed). Windows is not supported because there is currently no virtio-gpu driver for Windows that supports 3D acceleration. Note that newly created VMs will default to a \"GPU Supported\" display device on supported architectures but existing VMs must manually change the display device in Display settings. GPU acceleration is still an experimental feature, so it may not work in some situations (including many 3D use cases).\r\n* **EFI Boot**. By default new VMs created for pc, q35, and virt* machines will have EFI enabled. In previous versions, EFI is only enabled for virt* machines. Due to compatibility with boot, existing pc and q35 VMs will NOT have EFI enabled and must be manually turned on in Settings -> System -> Advanced Configuration -> UEFI Boot. This may also require you to re-install the bootloader on your VM. As part of this change, EFI variables will also be properly handled (on both ARM and x86 VMs). Note that if you've configured a custom pflash device for your VM, the new UEFI Boot option will take no effect (same as before).\r\n* **QEMU v6.1.0** is now used for the backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.1)\r\n* Fix crash when setting custom VM icon (#2387) (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Disable Port Forwarding feature for bridged networking (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed memory leak (#2720)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.2)\r\n* (iOS) Enable OpenGL acceleration for iOS 11-12\r\n* (iOS 15+) Increased memory limit for supported devices (M1 iPads currently)\r\n* (macOS) Fix layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey (#2644)\r\n* (macOS) Fix capturing of hotkeys (such as Cmd+Tab) (#2677)\r\n* Disable port forwarding options for shared & bridged networking\r\n* Fixed crash when PPC screamer is selected on iOS (currently this is still not supported)\r\n* Refactored non-OpenGL rendering code, fixing some random crashes seen in TestFlight reports.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.3)\r\n* (iOS) When a mouse/trackpad is already connected when UTM starts up, it will now be properly detected (#3013)\r\n* (iOS) Handle touch and Apple Pencil input while the mouse is captured (#2669)\r\n* Windows BSOD on boot/setup due to `PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA` (#2721)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.4)\r\n* (macOS) Settings no longer crash when an error occurs while saving a new VM\r\n* (iOS) GL rendering now works on EFI startup (black screen during boot) (#3076)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* v2.2.4 is built with Xcode 12.5.1 instead of Xcode 13.0 beta due to Apple's strict requirements in submitting apps built on beta SDKs. As a result, the layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey are back in v2.2.4. This will be resolved when Xcode 13 is released.\r\n* Networking can be broken in some instances, we are still investigating the cause.

This allows older Windows install to work out of the box.\r\n* Config: Quotes in custom arguments are no longer stripped (unless the only quotes wrap the entire argument) (#6343)\r\n* Config: Provide a fixed serial number for VirtIO block devices (#7332)\r\n* QEMU: Fixed an issue which causes Windows 98 to BSoD (#7342)\r\n* QEMU: Do not create a default floppy drive when -nodefaults is used. UTM configuration will set up a FDC device and this is the only way to set up bootindex for floppy.\r\n* Wizard: Legacy Windows configurations will now use PS/2 controller by default\r\n* Wizard: Update OS logos to be consistent with other icons\r\n* Wizard: Windows + i440fx hardware will now instantiate default devices (sound, VGA, networking) that should work with Windows 95/98\r\n* Wizard: Add additional supported hardware configurations for running older Windows\r\n* Wizard: Support floppy boot for Windows configuration\r\n* Scripting: New input automation suite for sending keyboard and mouse input (#6462)\r\n* USB: Fixed a rare crash when initializing the USB devices list (#5811)\r\n* SPICE: Fixed an issue where monitor configuration sent to spice-vdagent contains an invalid size (#5832)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Fix foreground issue on iOS 26 beta 5 and higher\r\n* (macOS) Added ability to auto-connect USB devices on start (#3400)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed connecting USB devices from secondary windows\r\n* (macOS) New \"Virtual Machine\" menu which mirrors the actions accessible through the toolbar\r\n* (macOS) Keyboard Shortcuts toolbar icon is no longer shown by default (it can be placed on the toolbar through View -> Customize Toolbar). It is also accessible through the \"Virtual Machine\" menu.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed sending simultaneous mouse button presses (#7068)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Add `version` command to detect current UTM version\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New option to disable key swapping on ISO keyboards (#6976)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New option to randomize network MAC addresses on clone (#7035)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.1)\r\n* New Liquid Glass icon thanks to @forcequitOS\r\n* Added App Intents for VM operations (#6245)\r\n* Added UEFI boot support for RISC-V64 and LoongArch64. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* QEMU PPC: Disable `bootindex` when `boot-device` is used in prom-env. This allows Yellow Dog Linux for PPC to work out of the box. (#6436)\r\n* QEMU x86_64: Fixed floppy boot order configuration for other PC models (isapc, i440fx) (#7166)\r\n* QEMU PPC/M68K: Includes classicvirtio drivers to support cursor input without capture and directory sharing (#6520)\r\n* QEMU M68K: Fixed virtio drive config (#7008)\r\n* Fixed a rare crash after stopping VM due to a race condition in libusb\r\n* Home: improve screenshot contrast in Dark Mode (#6894)\r\n* Config: Fixed a crash when trying to enter a large size value when creating a new drive (#7295)\r\n* Config: Corrected the default host IP address in port forwarding config to \"0.0.0.0\" when it incorrectly displayed \"127.0.0.1\" (#7132)\r\n* Keyboard Shortcuts: Create custom combinations of keyboard shortcuts from either Settings -> Input or via the Keyboard icon in the VM (press and hold on iOS/visionOS). This will allow you to easily send key commands such as Ctrl+Alt+Del or Stop+A to the VM. (#5698, #6310, #6757)\r\n* Wizard: New option to import an existing drive image when setting up a Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: New option to create a serial port only Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: Removed VHDX import option because Microsoft now provides ARM64 ISO images. Note: You can still create manually import an VHDX after creating a new VM.\r\n* Wizard: New template to create classic Mac OS VMs for M68K and PPC (#3504, #6890)\r\n* Wizard: Most common and supported machines for emulation are now listed prominently with the full list of supported QEMU architectures/targets hidden behind an \"Expert\" mode. This is necessary because most of the QEMU targets are not properly supported by the wizard anyways and does not generate a bootable config. They usually require a lot more manual tinkering. The page order of the wizard is also tweaked so the hardware config comes before the boot config now.\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when launching ArchLinux due to mis-handling of REV32\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when the first instruction executed is a goto\r\n* (iOS SE) Removed ARM32, RISC-V32, and added M68K. There is little use for ARM32 and RISC-V32 as they cannot boot anything useful that cannot also be booted by the 64-bit variant (which is still included).

Note: You can still create manually import an VHDX after creating a new VM.\r\n* Wizard: New template to create classic Mac OS VMs for M68K and PPC (#3504, #6890)\r\n* Wizard: Most common and supported machines for emulation are now listed prominently with the full list of supported QEMU architectures/targets hidden behind an \"Expert\" mode. This is necessary because most of the QEMU targets are not properly supported by the wizard anyways and does not generate a bootable config. They usually require a lot more manual tinkering.

When TSO is enabled on a guest operating system that is aware of the system register (i.e. Rosetta for Linux), performance of Intel emulation within the guest can be greatly improved. Note that if the guest kernel supports dynamically toggling TSO, you do not need to enable this.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Improved macOS guest support** The last window size (including full screen size) will be restored when the guest supports dynamic resolution. Removable drives and shared directories can now be ejected and changed while the macOS VM is running. Copy/paste synchronization between macOS 15 guest and host now works when the guest tools are installed (from the CD icon in the toolbar).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue with macOS 15.0 and 15.0.1 where accesses to files will fail due to a permission error. This issue has been resolved with macOS 15.1.\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue on M4 series of Macs where virtualization fails for macOS guests older than 13.4. The issue has been resolved with macOS 15.2.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* v4.6.5 reverted a change from v4.6.4 due to reports of crashes and kernel panics on some machines. As a result, there will be issues when upgrading to Windows 11 24H2 where the screen will go black.

Removable drives and shared directories can now be ejected and changed while the macOS VM is running. Copy/paste synchronization between macOS 15 guest and host now works when the guest tools are installed (from the CD icon in the toolbar).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue with macOS 15.0 and 15.0.1 where accesses to files will fail due to a permission error. This issue has been resolved with macOS 15.1.\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue on M4 series of Macs where virtualization fails for macOS guests older than 13.4. The issue has been resolved with macOS 15.2.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.4)\r\n* Fixed an issue with virtio-ramfb device where Windows may sometimes try to render to an inactive display target causing black screen, \"Guest has not initialized the display (yet)\", or broken cursor. This sometimes happens right after installing the viogpudo drivers for the first time and more recently while upgrading to Windows 11 24H2.

                    "localizedDescription": "**macOS Users:** there is no difference between v4.4.4 and v4.4.5. You do not need to update. \r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **macOS Sonoma support** New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore support for newer iOS** With the release of [TrollStore 2](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), this update brings JIT support for all iOS device that can run TrollStore. If (and only if) you are on at most iOS 16.3.1 AND your device is M1, M2, or A16, then you can also use the virtualization option. No other device or higher iOS version will likely ever be supported due to Apple [removing Hypervisor in iOS 16.4](http://twitter.com/utmapp/status/1708907045314035986). The only way around this is if Apple un-deletes the code (unlikely) or a jailbreak powerful enough to run a custom kernel is released (even more unlikely as this has never been done on a modern iOS device).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.5)\r\n* Fixed a \"device not found\" error when starting a VM with an empty interface (#5845)\r\n* Fixed JIT for TrollStore builds (#5216) (thanks @crstestacc)\r\n* Added support for virtualization on iOS 16.3.1 and lower (M1, M2, A16 only) (thanks @xliuxu)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed keyboard device not showing up on older macOS guests (#5814)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.3)\r\n* Guest Tools: supports caching the latest version and will only re-download when a newer version is available (#5692)\r\n* Fixed a bug where a suspended QEMU VM with a locked CD drive will refuse to resume\r\n* Localization: Updated Russian (thanks @s0rd3s)\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed display scaling sometimes not applying\r\n* (visionOS) Reimplemented multiple-window support with newer APIs and fixes an issue where the main window is resized on startup to the last VM display size\r\n* (visionOS) Process gaze touch events as indirect input\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard button was not opening the keyboard and sometimes causes the keyboard to keep popping up after being

Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed keyboard device not showing up on older macOS guests (#5814)\r\n\r\n## Changes

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n* If you suspended an Apple Virtualization VM in v4.4 and then downgrade to v4.3, you will not be able to resume the VM or start it at all. Please make sure you shut down any such VMs before downgrading or you may suffer data loss.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE.

However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.\r\n* Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.\r\n* Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)\r\n* Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved\r\n* Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)\r\n* Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)\r\n* Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters\r\n* Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation\r\n* Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.\r\n* Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release\r\n* Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically.

Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings.

                    "localizedDescription": "This version is broken due to a bug which prevents VMs from starting. Please update UTM to the latest version. If you obtained UTM from the Mac App Store, you may need to open the [App Store](itms-apps://apps.apple.com/updates) to the Updates tab to see it.\r\n\r\n## Highlights (Original)\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v8.0.2**\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nOn i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE.

Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.5)\r\n* Reverted ANGLE to an older version which includes the fix detailed in v4.2.4 but also does not break the Metal backend (#5238)\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj, @mavethee)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the pointer device stopped working on macOS Monterey guests (#5237)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Added option to use emulated trackpad (requires macOS Ventura guest)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`. You should now use similar properties in the `configuration` record\r\n* (macOS) Support changing the audio backend to CoreAudio and make CoreAudio the default (due to better latency and as a workaround to some crashes) (#5125)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.1)\r\n* QEMU: Support more than 8 cores for ARM64 targets (#4847)\r\n* Synchronize time on resume when QEMU guest agent is installed which should fix clock drift issues (#3218)\r\n* (iOS SE) Updated TCTI to latest branch from @ktemkin which has support for vector instructions (#4865)\r\n* (macOS) Switch to emulated trackpad when guest+host are macOS 13+ (second attempt for #4636 and #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the \"raw image\" checkbox when creating a new drive (#5100)\r\n* (macOS) Add PC speaker sound device as an option. You can now add a second sound device on supported targets (x86_64/i386 PC based targets) and set the hardware to PC Speaker to emulate older motherboard speakers.\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: new verbs \"open file\", \"execute\", and \"query ip\" which uses the QEMU guest agent to send commands to the guest. Use the Apple Script Editor's Open Dictionary tool for more information.\r\n* (macOS) CLI: new commands \"file push\", \"file pull\", \"exec\", and \"ip-address\". See `utmctl help` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.0)\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest (27/02/2023) commit\r\n* Automatically revert CPU to \"default\" if model is missing due to updated QEMU (#4910)\r\n* ~~Remove virtio-bus devices (they didn't work) (#4893)~~\r\n* Support drag and drop to import an .utm package (#3599)\r\n* Support copying sparse images across different volumes (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed tearing/performance issue for non-GL accelerated displays when under graphics load (#5049)\r\n* Fixed error when importing a new drive with the same name as an existing drive (#5052)\r\n* ~~Fixed a crash on startup when multiple audio devices are plugged in (#4629)~~\r\n* Wizard: Generate a working configuration for isapc (#4961)\r\n* Settings: Use pretty labels for CPU flags (#4940)\r\n* Translation: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Translation: added Czech readme (thanks @stinovlasmp)\r\n* Translation: updated German (thanks @LostInCompilation and @afh)\r\n* (macOS) Capture Mouse has been renamed to Capture Input and now will show the current capture status as a toggle button\r\n* (macOS) Apple VMs (macOS guests) now support Capture Input which will capture the system keys. This used to be always on as the default. It is now off by default and the toggle button will enable it.

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* (iOS SE) **TCTI backend updates**. Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`. You should now use similar properties in the `configuration` record\r\n* (macOS) Support changing the audio backend to CoreAudio and make CoreAudio the default (due to better latency and as a workaround to some crashes) (#5125)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.1)\r\n* QEMU: Support more than 8 cores for ARM64 targets (#4847)\r\n* Synchronize time on resume when QEMU guest agent is installed which should fix clock drift issues (#3218)\r\n* (iOS SE) Updated TCTI to latest branch from @ktemkin which has support for vector instructions (#4865)\r\n* (macOS) Switch to emulated trackpad when guest+host are macOS 13+ (second attempt for #4636 and #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the \"raw image\" checkbox when creating a new drive (#5100)\r\n* (macOS) Add PC speaker sound device as an option. You can now add a second sound device on supported targets (x86_64/i386 PC based targets) and set the hardware to PC Speaker to emulate older motherboard speakers.\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: new verbs \"open file\", \"execute\", and \"query ip\" which uses the QEMU guest agent to send commands to the guest. Use the Apple Script Editor's Open Dictionary tool for more information.\r\n* (macOS) CLI: new commands \"file push\", \"file pull\", \"exec\", and \"ip-address\". See `utmctl help` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.0)\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest (27/02/2023) commit\r\n* Automatically revert CPU to \"default\" if model is missing due to updated QEMU (#4910)\r\n* ~~Remove virtio-bus devices (they didn't work) (#4893)~~\r\n* Support drag and drop to import an .utm package (#3599)\r\n* Support copying sparse images across different volumes (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed tearing/performance issue for non-GL accelerated displays when under graphics load (#5049)\r\n* Fixed error when importing a new drive with the same name as an existing drive (#5052)\r\n* ~~Fixed a crash on startup when multiple audio devices are plugged in (#4629)~~\r\n* Wizard: Generate a working configuration for isapc (#4961)\r\n* Settings: Use pretty labels for CPU flags (#4940)\r\n* Translation: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Translation: added Czech readme (thanks @stinovlasmp)\r\n* Translation: updated German (thanks @LostInCompilation and @afh)\r\n* (macOS) Capture Mouse has been renamed to Capture Input and now will show the current capture status as a toggle button\r\n* (macOS) Apple VMs (macOS guests) now support Capture Input which will capture the system keys. This used to be always on as the default. It is now off by default and the toggle button will enable it.

                    "localizedDescription": "This is the same release as v4.1.5 but with the change to default enable GPU acceleration for Linux reverted. This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to `virtio-gpu-pci` or another card that does not have `-gl` in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* ~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.~~\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.6)\r\n* Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for \"Hardware OpenGL Acceleration\" which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.9)\r\n\r\n* Fixed some broken links to documentation (#4529)\r\n* Fixed an issue where running ARM64 emulation on ARM64 gives an error \"The \u2018host\u2019 CPU type can only be used with KVM or HVF\" (#4528)\r\n* Fixed a regression where S390x and SPARC VMs cannot start due to missing USB bus\r\n* (iOS) Fixed UTM SE cannot launch any VMs (#4516)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

                    "localizedDescription": "**Update [20/10/22]**: UTM SE build was removed and replaced with version v3.2.3 because of a bug that prevents any VM from starting up. If you have installed UTM SE v4.0.8, please re-install v3.2.3 or wait for the next update.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.\r\n* **Reclaiming space**: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.\r\n* **Disposable mode**: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select \"Run without saving changes\" to start VM in \"disposable mode.\" In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped.

Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.\r\n* **Reclaiming space**: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.\r\n* **Disposable mode**: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select \"Run without saving changes\" to start VM in \"disposable mode.\" In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped. (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* Reminder: for troubleshooting common Windows install issues (such as no networking), please check out the [guide](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/windows-10).\r\n* If you manually added `highmem=on` or `highmem=off` to your QEMU Machine Properties as a workaround to issues in a previous release, please remove it.\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.2.x will be the last update to support iOS 11-13.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.2.x. After that, iOS 14+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.3)\r\n* Disabled screenshots for GL virtual machines (workaround for a crash that occurs, this will be re-enabled in a future update once the crash is triaged)\r\n* (iOS) Pass through Esc key on external keyboard when VoiceOver is in use (#3940)\r\n* (macOS) Use correct scaling when HiDPI is enabled (#3968)\r\n* (macOS) Fix toolbar overlapping top of screen when \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar in full screen\" is unchecked in system preferences (#3919)\r\n* (macOS) When bridged networking is selected, default the interface to \"en0\" (#3945)\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: clarify that Linux kernel and initrd must be uncompressed if Apple Virtualization is used\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.2)\r\n* Add \"disposable mode\" (see highlights for more information) (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Do not enable UEFI for unsupported architectures (#3976)\r\n* Fix broken play button in sidebar (#3980)\r\n* Fix \"Error -1 while loading VM state\" on resume caused by usbredir (#3979)\r\n* Various UI tweaks and typo fixes (#3984)\r\n* Fixed pausing without saving state\r\n* Fixed showing warning prompt when VM is paused but not saved\r\n* (iOS) Detect if UTM is installed without AltStore and AltJIT will not attempt to be used.\r\n* (iOS) Reduced build size by 10% (thanks @Halo-Michael) (#3934)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference option to revert Caps Lock behaviour to pre 3.2.0 (#3974)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.1)\r\n* Fixed boot of RISC-V virt platform (thanks @wegank)\r\n* Remove `highmem=off` default property which is no longer needed on macOS 12.4+ and iOS 15.5+ (it will still be used on lower versions) (#3941, #3946)\r\n* Caps lock state will now be synchronized when mouse is captured (note that if mouse is captured before the guest OS has booted up, the state will be out of sync) (#3415)\r\n* Re-introduce option to disable auto-resolution when SPICE tools is installed (#3938)\r\n* When discarding unsaved settings, do not delete any disk image not created by UTM (#3587)\r\n* Fix downloading of UTM zip files when the URL does not end in \".zip\" (#3953)\r\n* (macOS) When importing a disk image, do not silently overwrite an existing image of the same name (#3866)\r\n* (macOS) Added option to reclaim unused space from disk image and to compress a disk image (macOS 12+ only)\r\n* (macOS) On the VM list, the start button will now change to a spinner when the VM is starting and will disappear when the VM has started. Also added the ability to start/show a VM by double-clicking on the list item (#3885)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.0)\r\n* Checkbox for \"Import VHDX Image\" in the wizard now works correctly again (#3760)\r\n* Fixed various crashes in SPICE webdavd share has been resolved thanks to updated backend (#3633)\r\n* Removed \"cache=writethrough\" argument from block devices since it was added to workaround an issue with VHDX images which we now convert to QCOW2\r\n* Added \"discard=unmap,detect-zeroes=unmap\" argument to block devices to reclaim unused space (#3460)\r\n* When \"do not save screenshot to disk\" is enabled, any existing screenshot will be deleted the next time the VM is started (#3936)\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU additional arguments where it sometimes would not appear after setting it (#3895)\r\n* Fixed RNG device not appearing in console mode even when enabled in the settings (#3790)\r\n* Added support for up to 5 additional mouse buttons (you may need to re-map them in the guest OS as they are automatically set to middle/up/down/side/extra) (#3906)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue in the legacy view where \"invalid identifier\" error may show up on a newly created VM (#3872)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when changing display settings while the VM window is open (but stopped) (#3925)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when trying to select \"Share...\" in context menu (#3915)\r\n* (macOS) Prevent allowing rapid clicking of pause/resume which may lead to VM corruption (#3629)\r\n* (macOS) Show progress indicator while VM is saving to prevent user from terminating the app early and cause corruption (#3752)\r\n* (macOS) Block unsupported Apple USB devices from being captured (#3759)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n* iOS 14 and below: There is a known issue crashing while running under taurine but not unc0ver.

See notes below for some limitations.\r\n* Wizard redesign (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories\r\n* Overhaul of the UTM backend which should improve application stability\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n* You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting \"Move...\" Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using \"File -> Import Virtual Machine...\" Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is *always* deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n* Default machine properties will now always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property `highmem=off` will be appended unless the user specifies `highmem=on` in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select `virt` in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with `highmem=off`. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires `highmem=off`. Advanced users can still specify `highmem=on` and it will not be overridden.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.5)\r\n* Fixed latest Linux kernel failing to boot (\u201cEFI stub: Exiting boot services and installing virtual address map...\u201d) (thanks @agraf for the fix) (#2682)\r\n* Fixed freezing during restart of a GL VM (#3746)\r\n* Clarified that clipboard sharing and auto resolution features are the same setting (#3748)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.4)\r\n* The changes to behaviour of \u201clegacy input\u201d introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak \u201cForce PS/2 Controller\u201d in the QEMU settings. (#3723)\r\n* The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)\r\n* \"Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines\" shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* (iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.3)\r\n* *Hotfix*: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed\r\n* Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.\r\n* The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)\r\n* Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding `virtualization=on` machine property (#3703)\r\n* Default machine properties will always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. (See notes above.)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1).

This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.\r\n* Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations\r\n* Show \"unavailable\" VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)\r\n* Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)\r\n* Rename \"import\" menu to \"open\" to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the \"open\" option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it\r\n* New context menu option \"New from template...\" can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)\r\n* Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in \"busy\" state\r\n* Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when \"legacy input\" is off. Renamed \"legacy input\" to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)\r\n* Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings\r\n* (iOS) Fixed launching on < iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)\r\n* (iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)\r\n* Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -> Tweaks).

Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1475606159428046854\r\n* **QEMU v6.2.0**: Updated QEMU backend to the latest release. Full changelog: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.2\r\n* (iOS 13+) **New toolbar**: The new toolbar is much more compact and friendly for smaller displays. It is also now movable and does not interfere with the iOS 15 multitasking button on the top center of the screen. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1407350167494443023\r\n* (macOS 12+, ARM64) **Virtualize macOS 12**: New integration with Apple's Virtualization.framework backend allows native hardware accelerated virtualization of macOS 12 (supporting both CPU and GPU virtualization). UTM can also download the latest macOS installer directly from Apple. (This is only supported on macOS 12+ running on an ARM64 Mac.)\r\n* (macOS 11+) **Virtualize Linux with Apple backend**: You now have the option to use Apple's Virtualization.framework to virtualize Linux. Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from `cortex-a72` to `default`. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the `cortex-a72` CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). `default` will use the `host` CPU model when virtualization is used and `cortex-a72` when emulation is used.\r\n* The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is **not** marked as \"GPU Supported\".\r\n* The cursor and resolution change issues on ARM64 Windows has been fixed in [SPICE tools 0.164.3][3]. If you are using an older version and experience such issues, please update to the latest SPICE tools.\r\n* If you manually added `virtualization=on` to your VM machine properties, you should remove it.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.4)\r\n* Introduced option to disable RNG device, which causes issues on FreeBSD (#3493)\r\n* Wizard: directory sharing is now enabled by default\r\n* Changed the default USB 3.0 controller from `qemu-xhci` to `nec-usb-xhci` which addresses an issue where the DVD drive disconnects randomly on Windows ARM64 and causes random errors during setup (#3194)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed save panel opening when you try to close the settings (#3494)\r\n* (macOS) Hide unsupported directory sharing options in macOS guests (#3496)\r\n* (macOS) Fix invert scrolling option (thanks @ktprograms) (#3497)\r\n* (macOS) Apple VM config files are now in plain-text (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* (macOS) Hide non-disk drives from the drives icon menu and properly describe the \"EFI Variables\" \"drive\" in settings\r\n* (macOS) Fixed suspend save state being broken in a previous update\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when a toolbar icon is hidden due to small window size and a toolbar option is selected from the menu\r\n* (macOS) The stop button in the main window will now stop the VM if it is started\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: Fix disabled button colour being the same as enabled buttons\r\n* (iOS) Moved the toolbar icon lower to not collide with the touch target for showing control center\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where settings are not shown if the context menu is used to open it (#3513)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.3)\r\n* Improvements to download UI (thanks @conath) (#3432)\r\n* Wizard: various improvements to creating Linux VMs (#3472)\r\n* (iOS) Add licensing text to app settings (#3236)\r\n* (macOS) DMG package now has a pretty icon and background (#3257)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference to terminate when all windows are closed (previously this was the default) (#3483)\r\n* (macOS) Fix custom icon for Apple VMs (#3477)\r\n* (macOS) Fix retina mode support for QEMU VMs (note that previously there was a global preference to enable retina mode that is now removed, per-VM setting should be used instead) (#3471)\r\n* (macOS) Remove QEMU VM setting for \"Fit to Screen\" as it was never implemented for macOS\r\n* ~~(macOS) Remove Apple VM setting for \"Retina (HiDPI) Mode\" as it was confusing and is not used for rendering (it just specifies the size of the virtual monitor)~~ This has been reverted in v3.0.4 and the Retina (HiDPI) Mode has been added back. A use for this feature is if you wish to take screenshots at specific resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.2)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed drive delete/move buttons not appearing on macOS 11 (#3461)\r\n* (macOS) Added missing network entitlement for bridged networking on Apple VMs\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: convert VHDX to QCOW2 when creating a Windows VM\r\n* (macOS) Any imported drive on an interface that is NOT floppy, pflash, or none will be converted to QCOW2.

Additionally, dynamic resolution (auto-change resolution when VM window is resized) and more fixed resolutions (matching all the screen resolutions of the latest Mac computers) were added to the driver. This requires you to download the latest SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ and run the installer again (or manually updating your GPU driver from the ISO if you know how).\r\n* In v2.4.0, newly created Q35 and PC machine (x86 and x86_64) defaulted to the `Skylake-Client` CPU model. Subsequently, it was discovered that the change caused performance regressions. v2.4.1 reverted the default CPU model to `Default` but if you created a new Q35/PC VM in v2.4.0, it is recommended that you manually change the CPU in System settings to `Default`.\r\n* Since v1.0.0, UTM used the RTL8139 network card as the default for Q35 VMs (x86 and x86_64) and Virt VMs (ARM64). There is a bug in the device implementation that causes the Windows driver to freeze the system and many users reported Windows Installer freezing as well as random freezes through normal use. In v2.4.0, we changed the default network card for Virt machines to `virtio-net-pci` and in v2.4.1, we changed the default network card for Q35 machines to E1000. However, this change only applies to newly created VMs, and any existing VMs may still suffer from the random freeze issues. It is recommended that you change your network card to `e1000` for Q35 machines and `virtio-net-pci` for Virt machines. Windows 7 and above should have the Intel E1000 network card drivers already installed, but the VirtIO Network card requires drivers in the SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ (if you previously installed this, you should have the drivers already on your system).\r\n* (macOS) Since v2.1.2, UTM provided an option (Cmd+,) to \"Use only performance cores by default\" which defaulted to off. When on, any VM which does not have a manually configured CPU count (> 0) will set the CPU count to the number of performance cores on the system. In v2.4.1, we have made this option on by default which means if you previously have not modified this option, then it will now be on. If you turned the option on, it should not change and if you turned the option on and later off again, it should still be off. The reason for this change was because users may not be aware of this option which can result in degraded performance when left off and we believe the default should reflect the best possible performance. Note that as before, if you manually set a VM's CPU count > 0, then this option does not change anything.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* (iOS) Integrated AltKit for automatically triggering AltJIT when installed with AltStore (1.5b2+) and AltServer (1.5b8+) (thanks @JoeMatt)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed sandbox issues (cannot select file) on jailbroken devices (thanks @Halo-Michael)\r\n* Improved zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Fixed inverted mouse cursor colour in Windows\r\n* New VMs will only use PCores by default (unless manually overridden with Preferences or per-VM config), this also fixes #3180\r\n* Changed default Q35 audio card to intel-hda\r\n* Changed default Q35 network card to E1000 and Virt network card to virtio-net (#3130)\r\n* Removed default CPU for Q35 and PC configurations because the Skylake-Client CPU resulted in performance regression (#3249)\r\n* Fixed downloadVM URL action when the ZIP name collides with the .utm name (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed a race condition leading to crash when a VM is shut down suddenly\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues",

You can configure it in the Network settings for your VM.\r\n* (macOS 11+ and iOS 13+) **GPU acceleration for OpenGL on Linux**. Use `virtio-ramfb-gl` or `virtio-vga-gl` display device and compatible Linux drivers (most modern Linux distros will have it already installed). Windows is not supported because there is currently no virtio-gpu driver for Windows that supports 3D acceleration. Note that newly created VMs will default to a \"GPU Supported\" display device on supported architectures but existing VMs must manually change the display device in Display settings. GPU acceleration is still an experimental feature, so it may not work in some situations (including many 3D use cases).\r\n* **EFI Boot**. By default new VMs created for pc, q35, and virt* machines will have EFI enabled. In previous versions, EFI is only enabled for virt* machines. Due to compatibility with boot, existing pc and q35 VMs will NOT have EFI enabled and must be manually turned on in Settings -> System -> Advanced Configuration -> UEFI Boot. This may also require you to re-install the bootloader on your VM. As part of this change, EFI variables will also be properly handled (on both ARM and x86 VMs). Note that if you've configured a custom pflash device for your VM, the new UEFI Boot option will take no effect (same as before).\r\n* **QEMU v6.1.0** is now used for the backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.1)\r\n* Fix crash when setting custom VM icon (#2387) (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Disable Port Forwarding feature for bridged networking (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed memory leak (#2720)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.2)\r\n* (iOS) Enable OpenGL acceleration for iOS 11-12\r\n* (iOS 15+) Increased memory limit for supported devices (M1 iPads currently)\r\n* (macOS) Fix layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey (#2644)\r\n* (macOS) Fix capturing of hotkeys (such as Cmd+Tab) (#2677)\r\n* Disable port forwarding options for shared & bridged networking\r\n* Fixed crash when PPC screamer is selected on iOS (currently this is still not supported)\r\n* Refactored non-OpenGL rendering code, fixing some random crashes seen in TestFlight reports.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.3)\r\n* (iOS) When a mouse/trackpad is already connected when UTM starts up, it will now be properly detected (#3013)\r\n* (iOS) Handle touch and Apple Pencil input while the mouse is captured (#2669)\r\n* Windows BSOD on boot/setup due to `PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA` (#2721)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.4)\r\n* (macOS) Settings no longer crash when an error occurs while saving a new VM\r\n* (iOS) GL rendering now works on EFI startup (black screen during boot) (#3076)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* v2.2.4 is built with Xcode 12.5.1 instead of Xcode 13.0 beta due to Apple's strict requirements in submitting apps built on beta SDKs. As a result, the layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey are back in v2.2.4. This will be resolved when Xcode 13 is released.\r\n* Networking can be broken in some instances, we are still investigating the cause.

Open Finder and go to your home directory.\r\n2. Press Cmd+Shift+. (that's the period key) to show hidden files.\r\n3. Browse to Library -> Containers -> UTM -> Data -> Documents\r\n4.

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU v9.1.2** The backend has been updated to the latest upstream QEMU which brings with it a variety of bug fixes and performance improvements.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Nested virtualization for Linux** Linux VMs using Apple Virtualization backend on macOS 15 and M3 or newer will now have nested virtualization enabled by default.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Total Store Ordering for QEMU** VMs using QEMU backend on macOS 15 can now enable TSO (in QEMU settings) at the hypervisor level. When TSO is enabled on a guest operating system that is aware of the system register (i.e. Rosetta for Linux), performance of Intel emulation within the guest can be greatly improved. Note that if the guest kernel supports dynamically toggling TSO, you do not need to enable this.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Improved macOS guest support** The last window size (including full screen size) will be restored when the guest supports dynamic resolution. Removable drives and shared directories can now be ejected and changed while the macOS VM is running. Copy/paste synchronization between macOS 15 guest and host now works when the guest tools are installed (from the CD icon in the toolbar).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue with macOS 15.0 and 15.0.1 where accesses to files will fail due to a permission error. This issue has been resolved with macOS 15.1.\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue on M4 series of Macs where virtualization fails for macOS guests older than 13.4. The issue has been resolved with macOS 15.2.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* v4.6.5 reverted a change from v4.6.4 due to reports of crashes and kernel panics on some machines. As a result, there will be issues when upgrading to Windows 11 24H2 where the screen will go black. An alternative fix with an updated driver will be provided as soon as possible, but for now if you plan to upgrade to Windows 11 24H2, it is recommended you do it from v4.6.4 before updating UTM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.5)\r\n* Reverted virtio-ramfb changes from v4.6.4 due to some users experiencing crashes and kernel panics. An alternative fix to the black screen issue will come in a Windows Guest Support driver update in the future. Until that is released, issue #6332 and #6883 will be unfixed.

                    "localizedDescription": "**macOS Users:** there is no difference between v4.4.4 and v4.4.5. You do not need to update. \r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **macOS Sonoma support** New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore support for newer iOS** With the release of [TrollStore 2](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), this update brings JIT support for all iOS device that can run TrollStore. If (and only if) you are on at most iOS 16.3.1 AND your device is M1, M2, or A16, then you can also use the virtualization option. No other device or higher iOS version will likely ever be supported due to Apple [removing Hypervisor in iOS 16.4](http://twitter.com/utmapp/status/1708907045314035986). The only way around this is if Apple un-deletes the code (unlikely) or a jailbreak powerful enough to run a custom kernel is released (even more unlikely as this has never been done on a modern iOS device).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.5)\r\n* Fixed a \"device not found\" error when starting a VM with an empty interface (#5845)\r\n* Fixed JIT for TrollStore builds (#5216) (thanks @crstestacc)\r\n* Added support for virtualization on iOS 16.3.1 and lower (M1, M2, A16 only) (thanks @xliuxu)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n* If you suspended an Apple Virtualization VM in v4.4 and then downgrade to v4.3, you will not be able to resume the VM or start it at all. Please make sure you shut down any such VMs before downgrading or you may suffer data loss.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices. However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.\r\n* Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.\r\n* Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)\r\n* Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved\r\n* Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)\r\n* Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)\r\n* Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters\r\n* Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation\r\n* Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.\r\n* Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release\r\n* Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically. This addresses an error that shows up if the Documents directory does not get created properly by macOS.

Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings.

                    "localizedDescription": "This is the same release as v4.1.5 but with the change to default enable GPU acceleration for Linux reverted. This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to `virtio-gpu-pci` or another card that does not have `-gl` in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* ~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.~~\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.6)\r\n* Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for \"Hardware OpenGL Acceleration\" which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856).

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL.

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.9)\r\n\r\n* Fixed some broken links to documentation (#4529)\r\n* Fixed an issue where running ARM64 emulation on ARM64 gives an error \"The \u2018host\u2019 CPU type can only be used with KVM or HVF\" (#4528)\r\n* Fixed a regression where S390x and SPARC VMs cannot start due to missing USB bus\r\n* (iOS) Fixed UTM SE cannot launch any VMs (#4516)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

                    "localizedDescription": "**Update [20/10/22]**: UTM SE build was removed and replaced with version v3.2.3 because of a bug that prevents any VM from starting up. If you have installed UTM SE v4.0.8, please re-install v3.2.3 or wait for the next update.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n* You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting \"Move...\" Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using \"File -> Import Virtual Machine...\" Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is *always* deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n* Default machine properties will now always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property `highmem=off` will be appended unless the user specifies `highmem=on` in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select `virt` in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with `highmem=off`. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires `highmem=off`. Advanced users can still specify `highmem=on` and it will not be overridden.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.5)\r\n* Fixed latest Linux kernel failing to boot (\u201cEFI stub: Exiting boot services and installing virtual address map...\u201d) (thanks @agraf for the fix) (#2682)\r\n* Fixed freezing during restart of a GL VM (#3746)\r\n* Clarified that clipboard sharing and auto resolution features are the same setting (#3748)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.4)\r\n* The changes to behaviour of \u201clegacy input\u201d introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak \u201cForce PS/2 Controller\u201d in the QEMU settings. (#3723)\r\n* The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)\r\n* \"Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines\" shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* (iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.3)\r\n* *Hotfix*: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed\r\n* Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.\r\n* The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)\r\n* Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding `virtualization=on` machine property (#3703)\r\n* Default machine properties will always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. (See notes above.)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories.\r\n* Fixed \"Failed to create new bookmark\" when trying to launch a VM shortcut\r\n* Automatically de-toggle UEFI boot tweak on unsupported targets\r\n* Fixed a situation that caused UTM to crash randomly (#3515)\r\n* (iOS 14) Toolbar had large overlapping icons on compact devices\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.2)\r\n* Fixed leaking of location data in debug.log (#3667)\r\n* Console mode settings for colours are slightly off from the picker values. This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.\r\n* Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations\r\n* Show \"unavailable\" VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)\r\n* Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)\r\n* Rename \"import\" menu to \"open\" to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the \"open\" option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it\r\n* New context menu option \"New from template...\" can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)\r\n* Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in \"busy\" state\r\n* Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when \"legacy input\" is off. Renamed \"legacy input\" to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)\r\n* Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings\r\n* (iOS) Fixed launching on < iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)\r\n* (iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)\r\n* Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -> Tweaks). This resolves clock issues on some Linux distros (#3104)\r\n* (iOS) Ability to fine tune cursor speed (in Settings) (#2522)\r\n* (iOS) Various improvements to scaling including fixing pinch to zoom on iOS 15\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a random crash due to iOS 15 dyld changes (#3672)\r\n* (macOS) Ability to turn off auto QCOW2 conversion when importing an image as well as the ability to create a raw disk image (#3637)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.1)\r\n* Automatically delete broken bookmarks for removable drives and shared directories after showing the error once (#3575)\r\n* Refactored backend QEMU VM manager to support Swift concurrency and also fix some rare race issues\r\n* Added picker for console background and text colour (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Added font style (bold/italics) for console font as well as font chooser for macOS (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed crash/freeze when using UTM URL actions (#3642)\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: style was incorrect on iOS 14\r\n* (iOS) Keyboard visibility state is now stored globally instead of per-VM\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard always pops up when an alert shows\r\n* (iOS) On iOS 13.4, old cursor functionality is restored when it was broken by the iOS 14 cursor implementation\r\n* (iOS) iOS 15 introduced a kernel race that leads to a panic and sometimes a purple screen and device reboot whenever GL is used. This has been fixed by reducing the possibility of the race (while we wait for Apple to fix it in iOS kernel) (#2743)\r\n* (iOS) Better error message when attempting to launch an unsupported architecture in UTM SE (#3635)\r\n* (macOS) Added descriptions to screen resolutions and notch-hiding resolutions (thanks @pointum)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.0)\r\n* Improved design of wizard on iOS (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @ty-yqs)\r\n* Refactored backend renderer into [CocoaSpice](https://github.com/utmapp/CocoaSpice)\r\n* Updated backend code to use Swift 5.5 concurrency features\r\n* In Apple VM configs, do not discard non-persistent settings (shared directories) when canceling out of settings window\r\n* Add option to run VM as a shortcut (see notes above) (#132, #1205)\r\n* Added icon for Pop! OS to picker (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed QEMU custom argument parsing when there is quoted space in middle of the argument (#3579)\r\n* Update the VM screenshot on a timer (#3499)\r\n* Added new global setting to disable saving screenshot to disk\r\n* Improved synchronization of state from the VM window and the main window (play button visible when stopped, busy spinner visible when starting, etc)\r\n* (iOS) Fix crash while installing on older versions of jailbroken iOS (#3543)\r\n* (macOS) Fix an issue where Apple VM aux storage was not created when switching from Linux to macOS boot option\r\n* (macOS) Ability to move a .utm VM to external storage\r\n* (macOS) Toolbar option to delete VM should be disabled when VM is running\r\n* (macOS) Support taking screenshots of Apple VMs\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n* iOS 14 and below: There is a known issue crashing while running under taurine but not unc0ver.

Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1475606159428046854\r\n* **QEMU v6.2.0**: Updated QEMU backend to the latest release. Full changelog: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.2\r\n* (iOS 13+) **New toolbar**: The new toolbar is much more compact and friendly for smaller displays. It is also now movable and does not interfere with the iOS 15 multitasking button on the top center of the screen. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1407350167494443023\r\n* (macOS 12+, ARM64) **Virtualize macOS 12**: New integration with Apple's Virtualization.framework backend allows native hardware accelerated virtualization of macOS 12 (supporting both CPU and GPU virtualization). UTM can also download the latest macOS installer directly from Apple. (This is only supported on macOS 12+ running on an ARM64 Mac.)\r\n* (macOS 11+) **Virtualize Linux with Apple backend**: You now have the option to use Apple's Virtualization.framework to virtualize Linux. Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from `cortex-a72` to `default`. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the `cortex-a72` CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). `default` will use the `host` CPU model when virtualization is used and `cortex-a72` when emulation is used.\r\n* The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is **not** marked as \"GPU Supported\".\r\n* The cursor and resolution change issues on ARM64 Windows has been fixed in [SPICE tools 0.164.3][3]. If you are using an older version and experience such issues, please update to the latest SPICE tools.\r\n* If you manually added `virtualization=on` to your VM machine properties, you should remove it.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.4)\r\n* Introduced option to disable RNG device, which causes issues on FreeBSD (#3493)\r\n* Wizard: directory sharing is now enabled by default\r\n* Changed the default USB 3.0 controller from `qemu-xhci` to `nec-usb-xhci` which addresses an issue where the DVD drive disconnects randomly on Windows ARM64 and causes random errors during setup (#3194)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed save panel opening when you try to close the settings (#3494)\r\n* (macOS) Hide unsupported directory sharing options in macOS guests (#3496)\r\n* (macOS) Fix invert scrolling option (thanks @ktprograms) (#3497)\r\n* (macOS) Apple VM config files are now in plain-text (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* (macOS) Hide non-disk drives from the drives icon menu and properly describe the \"EFI Variables\" \"drive\" in settings\r\n* (macOS) Fixed suspend save state being broken in a previous update\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when a toolbar icon is hidden due to small window size and a toolbar option is selected from the menu\r\n* (macOS) The stop button in the main window will now stop the VM if it is started\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: Fix disabled button colour being the same as enabled buttons\r\n* (iOS) Moved the toolbar icon lower to not collide with the touch target for showing control center\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where settings are not shown if the context menu is used to open it (#3513)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.3)\r\n* Improvements to download UI (thanks @conath) (#3432)\r\n* Wizard: various improvements to creating Linux VMs (#3472)\r\n* (iOS) Add licensing text to app settings (#3236)\r\n* (macOS) DMG package now has a pretty icon and background (#3257)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference to terminate when all windows are closed (previously this was the default) (#3483)\r\n* (macOS) Fix custom icon for Apple VMs (#3477)\r\n* (macOS) Fix retina mode support for QEMU VMs (note that previously there was a global preference to enable retina mode that is now removed, per-VM setting should be used instead) (#3471)\r\n* (macOS) Remove QEMU VM setting for \"Fit to Screen\" as it was never implemented for macOS\r\n* ~~(macOS) Remove Apple VM setting for \"Retina (HiDPI) Mode\" as it was confusing and is not used for rendering (it just specifies the size of the virtual monitor)~~ This has been reverted in v3.0.4 and the Retina (HiDPI) Mode has been added back. A use for this feature is if you wish to take screenshots at specific resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.2)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed drive delete/move buttons not appearing on macOS 11 (#3461)\r\n* (macOS) Added missing network entitlement for bridged networking on Apple VMs\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: convert VHDX to QCOW2 when creating a Windows VM\r\n* (macOS) Any imported drive on an interface that is NOT floppy, pflash, or none will be converted to QCOW2. This does not apply to removable drives.\r\n* (iOS) Improved toolbar visibility and dimming while idle behaviour\r\n* Wizard: skip drive creation if rootfs image is selected\r\n* Fixed an issue where an imported drive does not use the selected interface\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.1)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed launching on macOS 11 (#3433)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed \"auxiliaryStorage is nil\" when creating macOS VM on M1 Mac (thanks @pointum) (#3429)\r\n* (iOS) Proper enablement of extended RAM usage on M1 iPad 16GB (thanks @kkk669)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash on VM launch on < iOS 13 due to toolbar not being initialized\r\n* (iOS) Version information will now be shown in the system Settings app for UTM (at the bottom)\r\n* Fixed cursor and screen resolution issues on ARM64 Windows after installing SPICE tools. Requires updating SPICE tools to [latest version][3].\r\n* Add virtio-rng-pci device to fix boot warning about randomness source (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Default upscaling mode is now \"nearest neighbor\"\r\n* Fixed floppy drives being read-only (thanks @conath) (#3333)\r\n* Wizard: no longer use NVMe for Windows on x86_64 systems\r\n* Fixed a regression where Windows boots into BSOD often on x86_64 virtualization\r\n* Updated localization for Zh-Hant (thanks @pan93412)\r\n* Updated localization for Zh-Hans (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Fixed an issue where sometimes a VM will not boot due to invalid drive id (thanks @conath) (#3388)\r\n* Changing target to PC (i440FX) will now turn off hypervisor on x86_64 by default because it is unstable (#2420)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.0)\r\n* Added VM creation wizard\r\n* Updated QEMU to v6.2.0\r\n* Updated ANGLE to latest commit\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest commit (this may fix #2743)\r\n* Added `default` and `host` CPU option for ARM64 virtual machines. This will be the default for newly created VMs.\r\n* The downloader will no longer perform CRC checks on the ZIP file and this will significantly speed up extraction.\r\n* (iOS 13+) Redesigned toolbar (#496)\r\n* (macOS) Redesigned VM settings\r\n* (macOS) Fix crash moving drives (#3117)\r\n* (macOS) Make HVF per-VM configurable (#2493)\r\n* (macOS) Add Apple Virtualization.framework backend\r\n* (macOS) New Terminal frontend with SwiftTerm, currently only used with Apple backend on macOS\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization supports virtual serial port through PTY device\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[3]: https://mac.getutm.app/support/",

Additionally, dynamic resolution (auto-change resolution when VM window is resized) and more fixed resolutions (matching all the screen resolutions of the latest Mac computers) were added to the driver. This requires you to download the latest SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ and run the installer again (or manually updating your GPU driver from the ISO if you know how).\r\n* In v2.4.0, newly created Q35 and PC machine (x86 and x86_64) defaulted to the `Skylake-Client` CPU model. Subsequently, it was discovered that the change caused performance regressions. v2.4.1 reverted the default CPU model to `Default` but if you created a new Q35/PC VM in v2.4.0, it is recommended that you manually change the CPU in System settings to `Default`.\r\n* Since v1.0.0, UTM used the RTL8139 network card as the default for Q35 VMs (x86 and x86_64) and Virt VMs (ARM64). There is a bug in the device implementation that causes the Windows driver to freeze the system and many users reported Windows Installer freezing as well as random freezes through normal use. In v2.4.0, we changed the default network card for Virt machines to `virtio-net-pci` and in v2.4.1, we changed the default network card for Q35 machines to E1000. However, this change only applies to newly created VMs, and any existing VMs may still suffer from the random freeze issues. It is recommended that you change your network card to `e1000` for Q35 machines and `virtio-net-pci` for Virt machines. Windows 7 and above should have the Intel E1000 network card drivers already installed, but the VirtIO Network card requires drivers in the SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ (if you previously installed this, you should have the drivers already on your system).\r\n* (macOS) Since v2.1.2, UTM provided an option (Cmd+,) to \"Use only performance cores by default\" which defaulted to off. When on, any VM which does not have a manually configured CPU count (> 0) will set the CPU count to the number of performance cores on the system. In v2.4.1, we have made this option on by default which means if you previously have not modified this option, then it will now be on. If you turned the option on, it should not change and if you turned the option on and later off again, it should still be off. The reason for this change was because users may not be aware of this option which can result in degraded performance when left off and we believe the default should reflect the best possible performance. Note that as before, if you manually set a VM's CPU count > 0, then this option does not change anything.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* (iOS) Integrated AltKit for automatically triggering AltJIT when installed with AltStore (1.5b2+) and AltServer (1.5b8+) (thanks @JoeMatt)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed sandbox issues (cannot select file) on jailbroken devices (thanks @Halo-Michael)\r\n* Improved zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Fixed inverted mouse cursor colour in Windows\r\n* New VMs will only use PCores by default (unless manually overridden with Preferences or per-VM config), this also fixes #3180\r\n* Changed default Q35 audio card to intel-hda\r\n* Changed default Q35 network card to E1000 and Virt network card to virtio-net (#3130)\r\n* Removed default CPU for Q35 and PC configurations because the Skylake-Client CPU resulted in performance regression (#3249)\r\n* Fixed downloadVM URL action when the ZIP name collides with the .utm name (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed a race condition leading to crash when a VM is shut down suddenly\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues",

You can configure it in the Network settings for your VM.\r\n* (macOS 11+ and iOS 13+) **GPU acceleration for OpenGL on Linux**. Use `virtio-ramfb-gl` or `virtio-vga-gl` display device and compatible Linux drivers (most modern Linux distros will have it already installed). Windows is not supported because there is currently no virtio-gpu driver for Windows that supports 3D acceleration. Note that newly created VMs will default to a \"GPU Supported\" display device on supported architectures but existing VMs must manually change the display device in Display settings. GPU acceleration is still an experimental feature, so it may not work in some situations (including many 3D use cases).\r\n* **EFI Boot**. By default new VMs created for pc, q35, and virt* machines will have EFI enabled. In previous versions, EFI is only enabled for virt* machines. Due to compatibility with boot, existing pc and q35 VMs will NOT have EFI enabled and must be manually turned on in Settings -> System -> Advanced Configuration -> UEFI Boot. This may also require you to re-install the bootloader on your VM. As part of this change, EFI variables will also be properly handled (on both ARM and x86 VMs). Note that if you've configured a custom pflash device for your VM, the new UEFI Boot option will take no effect (same as before).\r\n* **QEMU v6.1.0** is now used for the backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.1)\r\n* Fix crash when setting custom VM icon (#2387) (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Disable Port Forwarding feature for bridged networking (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed memory leak (#2720)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.2)\r\n* (iOS) Enable OpenGL acceleration for iOS 11-12\r\n* (iOS 15+) Increased memory limit for supported devices (M1 iPads currently)\r\n* (macOS) Fix layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey (#2644)\r\n* (macOS) Fix capturing of hotkeys (such as Cmd+Tab) (#2677)\r\n* Disable port forwarding options for shared & bridged networking\r\n* Fixed crash when PPC screamer is selected on iOS (currently this is still not supported)\r\n* Refactored non-OpenGL rendering code, fixing some random crashes seen in TestFlight reports.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.3)\r\n* (iOS) When a mouse/trackpad is already connected when UTM starts up, it will now be properly detected (#3013)\r\n* (iOS) Handle touch and Apple Pencil input while the mouse is captured (#2669)\r\n* Windows BSOD on boot/setup due to `PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA` (#2721)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.4)\r\n* (macOS) Settings no longer crash when an error occurs while saving a new VM\r\n* (iOS) GL rendering now works on EFI startup (black screen during boot) (#3076)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* v2.2.4 is built with Xcode 12.5.1 instead of Xcode 13.0 beta due to Apple's strict requirements in submitting apps built on beta SDKs. As a result, the layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey are back in v2.2.4. This will be resolved when Xcode 13 is released.\r\n* Networking can be broken in some instances, we are still investigating the cause.

If you signed UTM yourself, make sure you chose a \"development\" certificate and in iOS App Signer, \"No get-task-allow\" is unchecked.\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][1] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[2]: https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/\r\n[3]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/blob/master/Documentation/TetheredLaunch.md\r\n[4]: https://github.com/DanTheMan827/ios-app-signer/pull/163",

                    "localizedDescription": "UTM 2.0 includes a redesign of the frontend for iOS 14 and introduces support for macOS 11. Due API limitations, the new design will **not** be available for iOS 13 and below. That means any feature that depends on the new design will also **not** be back-ported to iOS 13. Launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 14 will show the new design and launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 13 and below will show the old design. UTM 2.0 also updates the QEMU backend from 4.2.0 to 5.1.0 (for all supported iOS versions).\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions differ depending on what version of iOS you are running:\r\n\r\n* iOS 11-13: You can install and run UTM using any version of AltStore (recommended) or [iOS App Signer][2].\r\n* iOS 14: You must either be jailbroken or follow the [tethered launch][3] instructions every time you launch UTM.\r\n* iOS 14.2: You can use either the beta AltStore (1.4.2) or [iOS App Signer][2]. Note some people report issues with this, please [post the device model you're running if it does not work][4].\r\n\r\nNotice to users of previous versions: If you are running an older version of UTM (v1 or v2 beta), please note that because the bundle identifier has changed, it will install as a new app and AltStore will not show an update for your existing app. You should manually move your VMs to the new app. We are also retiring the distinction of beta vs release. Since we don't have dedicated testers or a QA team, it is misleading to label something as 'beta' or 'release' when every build incrementally improves upon the last one.\r\n\r\nAs always, please report all bugs to [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues)\r\n\r\nOne more thing... macOS 11 universal builds will now be included in the releases. Be warned that currently the macOS builds are still very unstable.\r\n\r\n## Changes (from last update)\r\n* Fix port forwarding (broken in last update)\r\n* (iOS 14) Add confirmation popup for delete/clone/stop operations\r\n* (iOS 14) Fix issue on iPad where a delete VM still shows its details page\r\n\r\n## Changes (highlights since v1.0)\r\n\r\n* (iOS 14) Brand new UI for the home view and configuration views\r\n* (iOS 14) Advanced mode: bypass QEMU arguments generated by configuration and pass args directly (#381)\r\n* (iOS 14) Sort VMs on home view (#356)\r\n* QEMU updated from 4.2.0 to 5.1.0\r\n* Removable drives and changing discs while VM is running (#109)\r\n* Jailbroken devices can use more JIT memory (#67)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][1] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[2]: https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/\r\n[3]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/blob/master/Documentation/TetheredLaunch.md\r\n[4]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/516",

Note: You can still create manually import an VHDX after creating a new VM.\r\n* Wizard: New template to create classic Mac OS VMs for M68K and PPC (#3504, #6890)\r\n* Wizard: Most common and supported machines for emulation are now listed prominently with the full list of supported QEMU architectures/targets hidden behind an \"Expert\" mode. This is necessary because most of the QEMU targets are not properly supported by the wizard anyways and does not generate a bootable config. They usually require a lot more manual tinkering. The page order of the wizard is also tweaked so the hardware config comes before the boot config now.\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when launching ArchLinux due to mis-handling of REV32\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when the first instruction executed is a goto\r\n* (iOS SE) Removed ARM32, RISC-V32, and added M68K. There is little use for ARM32 and RISC-V32 as they cannot boot anything useful that cannot also be booted by the 64-bit variant (which is still included). If you have a counter example of this, please open an issue on GitHub and we can consider re-adding it back in the future. However, removing these will make the app size a lot smaller. M68K is added to support classic Mac OS.\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed guest tools mounting (#7297)\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed stop button not working (#7298)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a bug where an error message on startup leads to the window being stuck (#7161)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable file locking so VMs can be launched from a network share or a filesystem that does not support locking (#7211)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable screenshots completely for privacy reasons (#6620)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to swap Ctrl and Cmd keys in VMs (#4003)\r\n* (macOS 26) Settings: Brand new layout with a sidebar to match other native apps\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Added clearer message when trying to install macOS beta without having the latest beta support tools installed\r\n* (macOS) AVF: New option to resize (expand) disk images (#6891)\r\n* (macOS 26) Fixed a layout issue with the resize image popover\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed hide sidebar button\r\n* (macOS) Config: Show localized network adapter names when available (#7287) (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed an issue where wrong UUIDs were generated for display configs (#7145)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.0)\r\n* Updated to QEMU v10.0.2\r\n* Config: In the RAM slider, the maximum value has been increased to 64GiB (note that you can always go above the slider limit by typing in the text box) (#7234)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed crash when VM name is empty (#7245)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Refactored toolbar button layout code\r\n* (macOS) Host only networks: you can set up multiple host-only networks (including ones shared by VMware) and have multiple VMs on the same virtual network (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: added option to boot Apple VMs into recovery mode (thanks @cees-elzinga)\r\n* (macOS) ~~Enable QEMU support for vmapple (#7150)~~ Machine model is removed for stability reasons but `apple-gfx-pci` is still supported for Intel VMs\r\n* (macOS) Rename the main window to 'UTM Library' (#7264)\r\n* (macOS) Display an error when IPSW install fails to load the file (instead of crashing) (#6855)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: Fixed a layout issue (#7117)\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization: Add support for ASIF drive images.

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* (macOS) **IMPORTANT NOTICE PLEASE READ**: There is a known bug in this version that prevents QEMU VMs from working. Please update to the latest version of UTM.\r\n* **QEMU v9.1.2** The backend has been updated to the latest upstream QEMU which brings with it a variety of bug fixes and performance improvements.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Nested virtualization for Linux** Linux VMs using Apple Virtualization backend on macOS 15 and M3 or newer will now have nested virtualization enabled by default.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Total Store Ordering for QEMU** VMs using QEMU backend on macOS 15 can now enable TSO (in QEMU settings) at the hypervisor level. When TSO is enabled on a guest operating system that is aware of the system register (i.e. Rosetta for Linux), performance of Intel emulation within the guest can be greatly improved. Note that if the guest kernel supports dynamically toggling TSO, you do not need to enable this.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Improved macOS guest support** The last window size (including full screen size) will be restored when the guest supports dynamic resolution. Removable drives and shared directories can now be ejected and changed while the macOS VM is running. Copy/paste synchronization between macOS 15 guest and host now works when the guest tools are installed (from the CD icon in the toolbar).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue with macOS 15.0 and 15.0.1 where accesses to files will fail due to a permission error. This issue has been resolved with macOS 15.1.\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue on M4 series of Macs where virtualization fails for macOS guests older than 13.4. The issue should be addressed by Apple in a future update. ([#6794](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/6794))\r\n* There is a known issue ([#6332](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/6332)) with Windows 11 24H2 that causes the display to show a black screen or \"Guest has not initialized the display (yet)\" upon boot. We recommend not upgrading to 24H2 for existing installs and 23H2 for new installs. If you have already upgraded, please follow the workaround described in the linked issue.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* The update to QEMU v9.1.2 will likely introduce other issues and regressions. If you experience any problem (crashes, performance, errors) that was not evident in v4.5.x, please [open an issue](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and provide all the requested information.

You do not need to update. \r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **macOS Sonoma support** New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore support for newer iOS** With the release of [TrollStore 2](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), this update brings JIT support for all iOS device that can run TrollStore. If (and only if) you are on at most iOS 16.3.1 AND your device is M1, M2, or A16, then you can also use the virtualization option. No other device or higher iOS version will likely ever be supported due to Apple [removing Hypervisor in iOS 16.4](http://twitter.com/utmapp/status/1708907045314035986). The only way around this is if Apple un-deletes the code (unlikely) or a jailbreak powerful enough to run a custom kernel is released (even more unlikely as this has never been done on a modern iOS device).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.5)\r\n* Fixed a \"device not found\" error when starting a VM with an empty interface (#5845)\r\n* Fixed JIT for TrollStore builds (#5216) (thanks @crstestacc)\r\n* Added support for virtualization on iOS 16.3.1 and lower (M1, M2, A16 only) (thanks @xliuxu)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed

(visionOS) Fixed display of release notes\r\n* (macOS) Allow clearing of installer IPSW from settings (#5611)\r\n* (macOS) Moved auto-capture of mouse/keyboard in full screen as a preference and do not enable it by default (#5633)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: File sizes displayed are now the size occupied on disk to be more consistent with QEMU VMs (#5637)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed macOS installer not working when a shared directory is selected (#5634)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where shared directory cannot be selected from the home screen (#5617)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where the

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **macOS Sonoma support** New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **visionOS support** UTM is now working on visionOS but until we get our hands on a real device, it is TBD on how to actually run it. If you are a lucky owner of a development unit, you can try it out yourself with the provided IPAs.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.3)\r\n* Guest Tools: supports caching the latest version and will only re-download when a newer version is available (#5692)\r\n* Fixed a bug where a suspended QEMU VM with a locked CD drive will refuse to resume\r\n* Localization: Updated Russian (thanks @s0rd3s)\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed display scaling sometimes not applying\r\n* (visionOS) Reimplemented multiple-window support with newer APIs and fixes an issue where the main window is resized on startup to the last VM display size\r\n* (visionOS) Process gaze touch events as indirect input\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard button was not opening the keyboard and sometimes causes the keyboard to keep popping up after being closed\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where `efi_vars.fd` is locked when the QEMU process deadlocks (#5769)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.2)\r\n* Added some default devices for PPC64 (#5737, #5734)\r\n* Fixed an issue where some VMs refuse to boot (#5745)\r\n*

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n* If you suspended an Apple Virtualization VM in v4.4 and then downgrade to v4.3, you will not be able to resume the VM or start it at all. Please make sure you shut down any such VMs before downgrading or you may suffer data loss.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices. However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.\r\n* Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.\r\n* Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)\r\n* Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved\r\n* Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)\r\n* Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)\r\n* Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters\r\n* Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation\r\n* Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.\r\n* Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release\r\n* Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically. This addresses an error that shows up if the Documents directory does not get created properly by macOS. (#5419)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where TSO setting was not saved\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where every time a VM is started with a terminal window, the width of the window gets a bit larger\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where starting a stopped VM does not change the display scale\r\n* (macOS) AVM: System keys will be captured automatically when entering full screen and released when exiting full screen (#3668)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Fixed the request stop method in both the GUI and scripting interfaces (#5425)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.1)\r\n* Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.2\r\n* Refactored QEMU support to a new project: [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit)\r\n* Machines with IDE interface (i44FX/PIIX) will now support two units per bus. Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings. (#5358)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @studio1a9)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when AVM window is closed (#5347)\r\n* (macOS) New option \u201cAutomatic\u201d for bridged network connection which will use the bridge the first active connection on the host. Both AVM and QEMU backends are supported. (#5410)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed trackpad setting not saving (#5369)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.0)\r\n* Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.0\r\n* Changed audio backend from CoreAudio back to SPICE (as it was before v4.2.x). Clarify that CoreAudio backend does not support microphone (#5253)\r\n* Add support for mouse buttons 4 and 5 (#5295)\r\n* Wizard: Properly display an error message when there is a failure writing to disk (#5271)\r\n* Fixed an issue where ISAPC emulation target cannot be started (#5280)\r\n* Fixed CoreAudio being instantiated even when audio is disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where legacy VMs with AC97 sound card has an empty name in settings\r\n* Fixed an QEMU issue where the `ucomiss` instruction causes a crash in some applications (#5294)\r\n* Fixed an issue preventing VMs with commas in their name from starting (note only new VMs will be fixed) (#5332)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Support canceling macOS installation\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Added `delete` command (#5290)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue creating a shortcut from drag & drop as well as double clicking from Finder (#5310, #5311)\r\n* (macOS) Added DHCP start/end settings for vmnet (#5301)\r\n* (macOS) Added automatically syncing of system clock when macOS wakes up from sleep (when QEMU guest agent is installed) (#5252)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM.HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nOn i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices. However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.\r\n* Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.\r\n* Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)\r\n* Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved\r\n* Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)\r\n* Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)\r\n* Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters\r\n* Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation\r\n* Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.\r\n* Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release\r\n* Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically. This addresses an error that shows up if the Documents directory does not get created properly by macOS. (#5419)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where TSO setting was not saved\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where every time a VM is started with a terminal window, the width of the window gets a bit larger\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where starting a stopped VM does not change the display scale\r\n* (macOS) AVM: System keys will be captured automatically when entering full screen and released when exiting full screen (#3668)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Fixed the request stop method in both the GUI and scripting interfaces (#5425)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.1)\r\n* Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.2\r\n* Refactored QEMU support to a new project: [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit)\r\n* Machines with IDE interface (i44FX/PIIX) will now support two units per bus. Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings. (#5358)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @studio1a9)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when AVM window is closed (#5347)\r\n* (macOS) New option \u201cAutomatic\u201d for bridged network connection which will use the bridge the first active connection on the host. Both AVM and QEMU backends are supported. (#5410)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed trackpad setting not saving (#5369)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.0)\r\n* Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.0\r\n* Changed audio backend from CoreAudio back to SPICE (as it was before v4.2.x). Clarify that CoreAudio backend does not support microphone (#5253)\r\n* Add support for mouse buttons 4 and 5 (#5295)\r\n* Wizard: Properly display an error message when there is a failure writing to disk (#5271)\r\n* Fixed an issue where ISAPC emulation target cannot be started (#5280)\r\n* Fixed CoreAudio being instantiated even when audio is disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where legacy VMs with AC97 sound card has an empty name in settings\r\n* Fixed an QEMU issue where the `ucomiss` instruction causes a crash in some applications (#5294)\r\n* Fixed an issue preventing VMs with commas in their name from starting (note only new VMs will be fixed) (#5332)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Support canceling macOS installation\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Added `delete` command (#5290)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue creating a shortcut from drag & drop as well as double clicking from Finder (#5310, #5311)\r\n* (macOS) Added DHCP start/end settings for vmnet (#5301)\r\n* (macOS) Added automatically syncing of system clock when macOS wakes up from sleep (when QEMU guest agent is installed) (#5252)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM.HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.5)\r\n* Reverted ANGLE to an older version which includes the fix detailed in v4.2.4 but also does not break the Metal backend (#5238)\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj, @mavethee)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the pointer device stopped working on macOS Monterey guests (#5237)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Added option to use emulated trackpad (requires macOS Ventura guest)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console.

                    "localizedDescription": "This is the same release as v4.1.5 but with the change to default enable GPU acceleration for Linux reverted. This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to `virtio-gpu-pci` or another card that does not have `-gl` in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* ~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.~~\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.6)\r\n* Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for \"Hardware OpenGL Acceleration\" which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.9)\r\n\r\n* Fixed some broken links to documentation (#4529)\r\n* Fixed an issue where running ARM64 emulation on ARM64 gives an error \"The \u2018host\u2019 CPU type can only be used with KVM or HVF\" (#4528)\r\n* Fixed a regression where S390x and SPARC VMs cannot start due to missing USB bus\r\n* (iOS) Fixed UTM SE cannot launch any VMs (#4516)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

See notes below for some limitations.\r\n* Wizard redesign (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories\r\n* Overhaul of the UTM backend which should improve application stability\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n* You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting \"Move...\" Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using \"File -> Import Virtual Machine...\" Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is *always* deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n* Default machine properties will now always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property `highmem=off` will be appended unless the user specifies `highmem=on` in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select `virt` in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with `highmem=off`. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires `highmem=off`. Advanced users can still specify `highmem=on` and it will not be overridden.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.5)\r\n* Fixed latest Linux kernel failing to boot (\u201cEFI stub: Exiting boot services and installing virtual address map...\u201d) (thanks @agraf for the fix) (#2682)\r\n* Fixed freezing during restart of a GL VM (#3746)\r\n* Clarified that clipboard sharing and auto resolution features are the same setting (#3748)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.4)\r\n* The changes to behaviour of \u201clegacy input\u201d introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak \u201cForce PS/2 Controller\u201d in the QEMU settings. (#3723)\r\n* The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)\r\n* \"Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines\" shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* (iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.3)\r\n* *Hotfix*: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed\r\n* Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.\r\n* The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)\r\n* Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding `virtualization=on` machine property (#3703)\r\n* Default machine properties will always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. (See notes above.)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories.\r\n* Fixed \"Failed to create new bookmark\" when trying to launch a VM shortcut\r\n* Automatically de-toggle UEFI boot tweak on unsupported targets\r\n* Fixed a situation that caused UTM to crash randomly (#3515)\r\n* (iOS 14) Toolbar had large overlapping icons on compact devices\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.2)\r\n* Fixed leaking of location data in debug.log (#3667)\r\n* Console mode settings for colours are slightly off from the picker values. This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.\r\n* Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations\r\n* Show \"unavailable\" VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)\r\n* Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)\r\n* Rename \"import\" menu to \"open\" to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the \"open\" option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it\r\n* New context menu option \"New from template...\" can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)\r\n* Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in \"busy\" state\r\n* Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when \"legacy input\" is off. Renamed \"legacy input\" to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)\r\n* Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings\r\n* (iOS) Fixed launching on < iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)\r\n* (iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)\r\n* Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -> Tweaks). This resolves clock issues on some Linux distros (#3104)\r\n* (iOS) Ability to fine tune cursor speed (in Settings) (#2522)\r\n* (iOS) Various improvements to scaling including fixing pinch to zoom on iOS 15\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a random crash due to iOS 15 dyld changes (#3672)\r\n* (macOS) Ability to turn off auto QCOW2 conversion when importing an image as well as the ability to create a raw disk image (#3637)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.1)\r\n* Automatically delete broken bookmarks for removable drives and shared directories after showing the error once (#3575)\r\n* Refactored backend QEMU VM manager to support Swift concurrency and also fix some rare race issues\r\n* Added picker for console background and text colour (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Added font style (bold/italics) for console font as well as font chooser for macOS (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed crash/freeze when using UTM URL actions (#3642)\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: style was incorrect on iOS 14\r\n* (iOS) Keyboard visibility state is now stored globally instead of per-VM\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard always pops up when an alert shows\r\n* (iOS) On iOS 13.4, old cursor functionality is restored when it was broken by the iOS 14 cursor implementation\r\n* (iOS) iOS 15 introduced a kernel race that leads to a panic and sometimes a purple screen and device reboot whenever GL is used. This has been fixed by reducing the possibility of the race (while we wait for Apple to fix it in iOS kernel) (#2743)\r\n* (iOS) Better error message when attempting to launch an unsupported architecture in UTM SE (#3635)\r\n* (macOS) Added descriptions to screen resolutions and notch-hiding resolutions (thanks @pointum)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.0)\r\n* Improved design of wizard on iOS (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @ty-yqs)\r\n* Refactored backend renderer into [CocoaSpice](https://github.com/utmapp/CocoaSpice)\r\n* Updated backend code to use Swift 5.5 concurrency features\r\n* In Apple VM configs, do not discard non-persistent settings (shared directories) when canceling out of settings window\r\n* Add option to run VM as a shortcut (see notes above) (#132, #1205)\r\n* Added icon for Pop!

Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1475606159428046854\r\n* **QEMU v6.2.0**: Updated QEMU backend to the latest release. Full changelog: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.2\r\n* (iOS 13+) **New toolbar**: The new toolbar is much more compact and friendly for smaller displays. It is also now movable and does not interfere with the iOS 15 multitasking button on the top center of the screen. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1407350167494443023\r\n* (macOS 12+, ARM64) **Virtualize macOS 12**: New integration with Apple's Virtualization.framework backend allows native hardware accelerated virtualization of macOS 12 (supporting both CPU and GPU virtualization). UTM can also download the latest macOS installer directly from Apple. (This is only supported on macOS 12+ running on an ARM64 Mac.)\r\n* (macOS 11+) **Virtualize Linux with Apple backend**: You now have the option to use Apple's Virtualization.framework to virtualize Linux. Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from `cortex-a72` to `default`. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the `cortex-a72` CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). `default` will use the `host` CPU model when virtualization is used and `cortex-a72` when emulation is used.\r\n* The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is **not** marked as \"GPU Supported\".\r\n* The cursor and resolution change issues on ARM64 Windows has been fixed in [SPICE tools 0.164.3][3]. If you are using an older version and experience such issues, please update to the latest SPICE tools.\r\n* If you manually added `virtualization=on` to your VM machine properties, you should remove it.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.4)\r\n* Introduced option to disable RNG device, which causes issues on FreeBSD (#3493)\r\n* Wizard: directory sharing is now enabled by default\r\n* Changed the default USB 3.0 controller from `qemu-xhci` to `nec-usb-xhci` which addresses an issue where the DVD drive disconnects randomly on Windows ARM64 and causes random errors during setup (#3194)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed save panel opening when you try to close the settings (#3494)\r\n* (macOS) Hide unsupported directory sharing options in macOS guests (#3496)\r\n* (macOS) Fix invert scrolling option (thanks @ktprograms) (#3497)\r\n* (macOS) Apple VM config files are now in plain-text (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* (macOS) Hide non-disk drives from the drives icon menu and properly describe the \"EFI Variables\" \"drive\" in settings\r\n* (macOS) Fixed suspend save state being broken in a previous update\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when a toolbar icon is hidden due to small window size and a toolbar option is selected from the menu\r\n* (macOS) The stop button in the main window will now stop the VM if it is started\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: Fix disabled button colour being the same as enabled buttons\r\n* (iOS) Moved the toolbar icon lower to not collide with the touch target for showing control center\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where settings are not shown if the context menu is used to open it (#3513)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.3)\r\n* Improvements to download UI (thanks @conath) (#3432)\r\n* Wizard: various improvements to creating Linux VMs (#3472)\r\n* (iOS) Add licensing text to app settings (#3236)\r\n* (macOS) DMG package now has a pretty icon and background (#3257)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference to terminate when all windows are closed (previously this was the default) (#3483)\r\n* (macOS) Fix custom icon for Apple VMs (#3477)\r\n* (macOS) Fix retina mode support for QEMU VMs (note that previously there was a global preference to enable retina mode that is now removed, per-VM setting should be used instead) (#3471)\r\n* (macOS) Remove QEMU VM setting for \"Fit to Screen\" as it was never implemented for macOS\r\n* ~~(macOS) Remove Apple VM setting for \"Retina (HiDPI) Mode\" as it was confusing and is not used for rendering (it just specifies the size of the virtual monitor)~~ This has been reverted in v3.0.4 and the Retina (HiDPI) Mode has been added back. A use for this feature is if you wish to take screenshots at specific resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.2)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed drive delete/move buttons not appearing on macOS 11 (#3461)\r\n* (macOS) Added missing network entitlement for bridged networking on Apple VMs\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: convert VHDX to QCOW2 when creating a Windows VM\r\n* (macOS) Any imported drive on an interface that is NOT floppy, pflash, or none will be converted to QCOW2. This does not apply to removable drives.\r\n* (iOS) Improved toolbar visibility and dimming while idle behaviour\r\n* Wizard: skip drive creation if rootfs image is selected\r\n* Fixed an issue where an imported drive does not use the selected interface\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.1)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed launching on macOS 11 (#3433)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed \"auxiliaryStorage is nil\" when creating macOS VM on M1 Mac (thanks @pointum) (#3429)\r\n* (iOS) Proper enablement of extended RAM usage on M1 iPad 16GB (thanks @kkk669)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash on VM launch on < iOS 13 due to toolbar not being initialized\r\n* (iOS) Version information will now be shown in the system Settings app for UTM (at the bottom)\r\n* Fixed cursor and screen resolution issues on ARM64 Windows after installing SPICE tools. Requires updating SPICE tools to [latest version][3].\r\n* Add virtio-rng-pci device to fix boot warning about randomness source (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Default upscaling mode is now \"nearest neighbor\"\r\n* Fixed floppy drives being read-only (thanks @conath) (#3333)\r\n* Wizard: no longer use NVMe for Windows on x86_64 systems\r\n* Fixed a regression where Windows boots into BSOD often on x86_64 virtualization\r\n* Updated localization for Zh-Hant (thanks @pan93412)\r\n* Updated localization for Zh-Hans (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Fixed an issue where sometimes a VM will not boot due to invalid drive id (thanks @conath) (#3388)\r\n* Changing target to PC (i440FX) will now turn off hypervisor on x86_64 by default because it is unstable (#2420)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.0)\r\n* Added VM creation wizard\r\n* Updated QEMU to v6.2.0\r\n* Updated ANGLE to latest commit\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest commit (this may fix #2743)\r\n* Added `default` and `host` CPU option for ARM64 virtual machines. This will be the default for newly created VMs.\r\n* The downloader will no longer perform CRC checks on the ZIP file and this will significantly speed up extraction.\r\n* (iOS 13+) Redesigned toolbar (#496)\r\n* (macOS) Redesigned VM settings\r\n* (macOS) Fix crash moving drives (#3117)\r\n* (macOS) Make HVF per-VM configurable (#2493)\r\n* (macOS) Add Apple Virtualization.framework backend\r\n* (macOS) New Terminal frontend with SwiftTerm, currently only used with Apple backend on macOS\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization supports virtual serial port through PTY device\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[3]: https://mac.getutm.app/support/",

Additionally, dynamic resolution (auto-change resolution when VM window is resized) and more fixed resolutions (matching all the screen resolutions of the latest Mac computers) were added to the driver. This requires you to download the latest SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ and run the installer again (or manually updating your GPU driver from the ISO if you know how).\r\n* In v2.4.0, newly created Q35 and PC machine (x86 and x86_64) defaulted to the `Skylake-Client` CPU model. Subsequently, it was discovered that the change caused performance regressions. v2.4.1 reverted the default CPU model to `Default` but if you created a new Q35/PC VM in v2.4.0, it is recommended that you manually change the CPU in System settings to `Default`.\r\n* Since v1.0.0, UTM used the RTL8139 network card as the default for Q35 VMs (x86 and x86_64) and Virt VMs (ARM64). There is a bug in the device implementation that causes the Windows driver to freeze the system and many users reported Windows Installer freezing as well as random freezes through normal use. In v2.4.0, we changed the default network card for Virt machines to `virtio-net-pci` and in v2.4.1, we changed the default network card for Q35 machines to E1000. However, this change only applies to newly created VMs, and any existing VMs may still suffer from the random freeze issues. It is recommended that you change your network card to `e1000` for Q35 machines and `virtio-net-pci` for Virt machines. Windows 7 and above should have the Intel E1000 network card drivers already installed, but the VirtIO Network card requires drivers in the SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ (if you previously installed this, you should have the drivers already on your system).\r\n* (macOS) Since v2.1.2, UTM provided an option (Cmd+,) to \"Use only performance cores by default\" which defaulted to off. When on, any VM which does not have a manually configured CPU count (> 0) will set the CPU count to the number of performance cores on the system. In v2.4.1, we have made this option on by default which means if you previously have not modified this option, then it will now be on. If you turned the option on, it should not change and if you turned the option on and later off again, it should still be off. The reason for this change was because users may not be aware of this option which can result in degraded performance when left off and we believe the default should reflect the best possible performance. Note that as before, if you manually set a VM's CPU count > 0, then this option does not change anything.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* (iOS) Integrated AltKit for automatically triggering AltJIT when installed with AltStore (1.5b2+) and AltServer (1.5b8+) (thanks @JoeMatt)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed sandbox issues (cannot select file) on jailbroken devices (thanks @Halo-Michael)\r\n* Improved zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Fixed inverted mouse cursor colour in Windows\r\n* New VMs will only use PCores by default (unless manually overridden with Preferences or per-VM config), this also fixes #3180\r\n* Changed default Q35 audio card to intel-hda\r\n* Changed default Q35 network card to E1000 and Virt network card to virtio-net (#3130)\r\n* Removed default CPU for Q35 and PC configurations because the Skylake-Client CPU resulted in performance regression (#3249)\r\n* Fixed downloadVM URL action when the ZIP name collides with the .utm name (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed a race condition leading to crash when a VM is shut down suddenly\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues",

You can configure it in the Network settings for your VM.\r\n* (macOS 11+ and iOS 13+) **GPU acceleration for OpenGL on Linux**. Use `virtio-ramfb-gl` or `virtio-vga-gl` display device and compatible Linux drivers (most modern Linux distros will have it already installed). Windows is not supported because there is currently no virtio-gpu driver for Windows that supports 3D acceleration. Note that newly created VMs will default to a \"GPU Supported\" display device on supported architectures but existing VMs must manually change the display device in Display settings. GPU acceleration is still an experimental feature, so it may not work in some situations (including many 3D use cases).\r\n* **EFI Boot**. By default new VMs created for pc, q35, and virt* machines will have EFI enabled. In previous versions, EFI is only enabled for virt* machines. Due to compatibility with boot, existing pc and q35 VMs will NOT have EFI enabled and must be manually turned on in Settings -> System -> Advanced Configuration -> UEFI Boot. This may also require you to re-install the bootloader on your VM. As part of this change, EFI variables will also be properly handled (on both ARM and x86 VMs). Note that if you've configured a custom pflash device for your VM, the new UEFI Boot option will take no effect (same as before).\r\n* **QEMU v6.1.0** is now used for the backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.1)\r\n* Fix crash when setting custom VM icon (#2387) (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Disable Port Forwarding feature for bridged networking (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed memory leak (#2720)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.2)\r\n* (iOS) Enable OpenGL acceleration for iOS 11-12\r\n* (iOS 15+) Increased memory limit for supported devices (M1 iPads currently)\r\n* (macOS) Fix layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey (#2644)\r\n* (macOS) Fix capturing of hotkeys (such as Cmd+Tab) (#2677)\r\n* Disable port forwarding options for shared & bridged networking\r\n* Fixed crash when PPC screamer is selected on iOS (currently this is still not supported)\r\n* Refactored non-OpenGL rendering code, fixing some random crashes seen in TestFlight reports.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.3)\r\n* (iOS) When a mouse/trackpad is already connected when UTM starts up, it will now be properly detected (#3013)\r\n* (iOS) Handle touch and Apple Pencil input while the mouse is captured (#2669)\r\n* Windows BSOD on boot/setup due to `PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA` (#2721)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.4)\r\n* (macOS) Settings no longer crash when an error occurs while saving a new VM\r\n* (iOS) GL rendering now works on EFI startup (black screen during boot) (#3076)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* v2.2.4 is built with Xcode 12.5.1 instead of Xcode 13.0 beta due to Apple's strict requirements in submitting apps built on beta SDKs. As a result, the layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey are back in v2.2.4. This will be resolved when Xcode 13 is released.\r\n* Networking can be broken in some instances, we are still investigating the cause.

If you signed UTM yourself, make sure you chose a \"development\" certificate and in iOS App Signer, \"No get-task-allow\" is unchecked.\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][1] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[2]: https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/\r\n[3]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/blob/master/Documentation/TetheredLaunch.md\r\n[4]: https://github.com/DanTheMan827/ios-app-signer/pull/163",

                    "localizedDescription": "UTM 2.0 includes a redesign of the frontend for iOS 14 and introduces support for macOS 11. Due API limitations, the new design will **not** be available for iOS 13 and below. That means any feature that depends on the new design will also **not** be back-ported to iOS 13. Launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 14 will show the new design and launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 13 and below will show the old design. UTM 2.0 also updates the QEMU backend from 4.2.0 to 5.1.0 (for all supported iOS versions).\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions differ depending on what version of iOS you are running:\r\n\r\n* iOS 11-13: You can install and run UTM using any version of AltStore (recommended) or [iOS App Signer][2].\r\n* iOS 14: You must either be jailbroken or follow the [tethered launch][3] instructions every time you launch UTM.\r\n* iOS 14.2: You can use either the beta AltStore (1.4.2) or [iOS App Signer][2]. Note some people report issues with this, please [post the device model you're running if it does not work][4].\r\n\r\nNotice to users of previous versions: If you are running an older version of UTM (v1 or v2 beta), please note that because the bundle identifier has changed, it will install as a new app and AltStore will not show an update for your existing app. You should manually move your VMs to the new app. We are also retiring the distinction of beta vs release. Since we don't have dedicated testers or a QA team, it is misleading to label something as 'beta' or 'release' when every build incrementally improves upon the last one.\r\n\r\nAs always, please report all bugs to [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues)\r\n\r\nOne more thing... macOS 11 universal builds will now be included in the releases. Be warned that currently the macOS builds are still very unstable.\r\n\r\n## Changes (from last update)\r\n* Fix port forwarding (broken in last update)\r\n* (iOS 14) Add confirmation popup for delete/clone/stop operations\r\n* (iOS 14) Fix issue on iPad where a delete VM still shows its details page\r\n\r\n## Changes (highlights since v1.0)\r\n\r\n* (iOS 14) Brand new UI for the home view and configuration views\r\n* (iOS 14) Advanced mode: bypass QEMU arguments generated by configuration and pass args directly (#381)\r\n* (iOS 14) Sort VMs on home view (#356)\r\n* QEMU updated from 4.2.0 to 5.1.0\r\n* Removable drives and changing discs while VM is running (#109)\r\n* Jailbroken devices can use more JIT memory (#67)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][1] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[2]: https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/\r\n[3]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/blob/master/Documentation/TetheredLaunch.md\r\n[4]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/516",

            "localizedDescription": "Pocket8\nA native PICO-8 emulator for iOS that bridges the gap between web flexibility and native filesystem access!\n\nFeatures:\n- Native Persistence: Implements a custom \"Handoff & Sync\" protocol ensuring 100% save-state integrity across app restarts.\n- Quick Save & Load: The only PICO-8 experience with instant save states. Freeze time and resume anywhere, across devices.\n\n- Adaptive Controls: Custom Gameboy-esque controls with beautiful haptics. Emulator works in portrait and landscape modes.\n- Smart Library: Automatically extracts cartridge labels and metadata, presenting your collection in a polished grid.\n\nProject Status:\nThis is a solo dev project designed to push the limits of WebAssembly-to-Native bridging. While an App Store release is a future possibility that I'm gunning for, the current priority is maintaining an uncompromised, open-source experience for the PICO-8 community.\n\nHow to Get Games\nPocket8 uses standard PICO-8 cartridges\n1.  Visit the BBS**: Go to https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/ or https://itch.io/games/tag-pico-8\n2.  Look for the Cart: You need the cartridge file, not a zip or exe. Look for the little square image that looks like the game cover.\n3.  Save It:\n    - Desktop: Right-click the small \"Cart\" icon -> \"Save Image As\".\n    - iOS: Tap and hold the cart image -> \"Save to Files\".\n4.  Import: In Pocket8, tap the `+` icon and select your saved `.p8.png` file.\n\nPro Tip: If you see a file named `thumb.png` or `cover.png ...`, that's usually just a picture. You specifically need the file that often ends in `.p8.png` and looks like a game cartridge.",

Pocket8 is now officially running on Android!\r\n\r\n**New Features:**\r\n- **Android Support:** There was a huge demand for this. I'm listening! I don't have an Android device to test on currently, so please leave feedback.\r\n- **Multicart Support:** .p8.png Multi-Cart titles are now supported. **Note: .p8 Multi-Cart titles are not.** The current engine is a web-build, and does not usually support .p8 files or multicart titles at all. However, games that use absolute file names when loading carts in their code work fine. An example of a working multicart game is [Golf Monday](https://johanpeitz.itch.io/golf-monday).\r\n- **Library Management:** You can now rename and favorite your carts. Long-press to organize your collection.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jevonlipsey/pico-ios/main/assets/pocket8v1.5-demo.gif\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"demo-gif\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n**Coming Soon:**\r\n- **Official integration is in the works!** I've been in touch with Zep, and we are collaborating towards making Pocket8 the official playing experience on iOS and mobile. Stay tuned.\r\n- Gamepad support + fullscreen mode, for Android handhelds specifically.\r\n- Check the Github issues for more small things I plan on adding.",

            "localizedDescription": "This app allows you to install and manage applications contained in a single app, using certificate pairs and various installation techniques to allow apps to install to your device. This is an entirely stock application and uses built-in features to be able to do this!\n\nFeatures:\n- User friendly, and clean UI.\n- Sign and install applications.\n- Supports [AltStore](https://faq.altstore.io/distribute-your-apps/make-a-source#apps) repositories.\n- View detailed information about apps and your certificates.\n- Configurable signing options mainly for modifying the app, such as appearance and allowing support for the files app.\n  - This includes patching apps for compatibility and Liquid Glass.\n- Tweak support for advanced users, using [Ellekit](https://github.com/tealbathingsuit/ellekit) for injection. \n  - Supports injecting `.deb` and `.dylib` files.\n- Actively maintained: always ensuring most apps get installed properly.\n- No tracking or analytics, ensuring user privacy.\n- Of course, open source and free.\n\n\nHow does it work?\nHow Feather works is a bit complicated, with having multiple ways to install, app management, tweaks, etc. However, I'll point out how the important features work here.\n\nTo start off, we need a validly signed IPA. We can achieve this with Zsign, using a provided IPA using a `.p12` and `.mobileprovision` pair.\n\nInstall (Server)\n- Use a locally hosted server for hosting the IPA files used for installation, including other assets such as icons, etc. \n  - On iOS 18, we need a few entitlements: `Associated Domains`, `Custom Network Protocol`, `MDM Managed Associated Domains`, `Network Extensions`\n- Make sure to include valid https SSL certificates as the next URL requires a valid HTTPS connection, for us we use [*.backloop.dev](https://backloop.dev/).\n- We then use `itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=<PLIST_URL>` to attempt to initiate an install, by using `UIApplication.open`.\n\nHowever, due to the changes with iOS 18 with entitlements we will need to provide an alternative way of installing. We have two options here, a way to install locally fully using the local server (the one I have just shown) or use an external HTTPS server that serves as our middle man for our `PLIST_URL`, while having the files still local to us. Lets show the latter.\n\n- This time, lets not include https SSL certificates, rather just have a plain insecure local server.\n- Instead of a locally hosting our `PLIST_URL`, we use [plistserver](https://github.com/nekohaxx/plistserver) to host a server online specifically for retrieving it. This still requires a valid HTTPS connection.\n- Now, to even initiate the install (due to lack of entitlements from the former) we need to trick iOS into opening the `itms-services://` URL, we can do this by summoning a Safari webview to a locally hosted HTML page with a script to forcefully redirect us to that itms-services URL.\n\nSince itms-services initiates the install automatically, we don't need to do anything extra after the process. Though, what we do is monitor the streaming progress of the IPA being sent.\n\nInstall (Pairing)\n- Establish a heartbeat with a TCP provider (the app will need this for later).\n  - For it to be successful, we need a [pairing file](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice_pair) and a [VPN](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localdevvpn/id6755608044).\n- Once we have these and the connection was successfully established, we can move on to the installation part.\n  - Before installing, we need to check for the connection to the socket that has been created, routed to `10.7.0.1`, if this succeeds we're ready.\n- When preparing for installation, we need to establish another connection but for `AFC` using the TCP provider.\n- Once the connection was established we need to created a staging directory to `/PublicStaging/` and upload our IPA there.\n- Then, using our connection to `AFC` we can command it to install that IPA directly. Similar to `ideviceinstaller`, but fully on your phone.\n\nDue to how it works right now we need both a VPN and a lockdownd pairing file, this means you will need a computer for its initial setup. Though, if you don't want to do these you can just use the server way of installing instead (but at a cost of less reliability). \n",

Onion Browser helps you access the internet with more safety and privacy, and no extra cost to you.\n\n\u201cThe best Tor-related offering on iOS right now is Onion Browser\u201d - The Daily Dot, October 14, 2015.\n\nFeatured in: The New York Times, The Guardian, Salon, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Boing Boing, Lifehacker, Macworld, The Daily Dot, & others.\n\nFEATURES:\n\u2022 Browse the internet over Tor:\n- Protect your privacy from website tracking\n- Secure your traffic from insecure wireless networks and ISPs\n- Access .onion sites that are only accessible over Tor.\n\n\u2022 Fight online tracking: block scripts and automatically clear cookies and tabs, based on your preferences.\n\n\u2022 And more privacy-enhancing features!\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\n- Web browsing is much slower than through a normal web browser or a VPN because your traffic is encrypted and relayed through the Tor network.\n\n- Onion Browser might not work on networks with advanced network restrictions. If the app does not connect, try using bridges (or a different type of bridge), force-quit, and then restart the app.\n\n- Use of Onion Browser is at your own risk; remember that sensitive data does not always belong on a mobile device.\n\n** Onion Browser is free and open-source software. You can read more about Onion Browser and how to support development of Tor on iOS by visiting onionbrowser.com ** ",

The ethos of the app is to merge the technologies of today with a pixel-perfect recreation of the user experience of the past. The vast majority of apps in OldOS are fully functional \u2014 meaning they seamlessly integrate with the data on your phone to deliver a live, emulator-esque experience. What does this mean? Well, you can play your music in iPod, get directions in Maps, surf the web in Safari, view the current weather in Weather, and much more. By the same token, no shortcuts were taken in fully fleshing out the operating system. You can change your background, adjust settings, search apps, et cetera. There are a few apps still not ready for primetime but don't worry, they're coming soon.\n\nWith OldOS, you no longer need to worry about securing a legacy iPhone to experience nostalgia \u2014 it's available on your daily driver.\n\nPart of the goal with OldOS is to enable anyone to understand how iOS works and demonstrate just how powerful SwiftUI truly is. For that reason, the entire app is open-sourced \u2014 enabling developers to learn about, modify, and add to the app. I thought building this over my last six or so months in high school and sharing it with the world would be a fun and productive endeavor.",

@ToddLa\r\n\ud83d\udc49 @ac90b671\r\n\ud83d\udc49 @nenge123\r\n\ud83d\udc49 @david.nicolson\r\n\ud83d\udc49 @davidmuzi\r\n\ud83d\udc49 @amoorecodes\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- Controllers:\r\n  - On Screen Joystick Controls for N64 and PSX\r\n  - APIs for keyboard, mouse, rumble, on-screen joystick. (coming in future release)\r\n  - Apple TV: Support new Siri remote (MicroGamepad and DirectionalGamepad)\r\n- Code Signing is now managed with an XCConfig file. See `CodeSigning.xcconfig.example` for instructions. (Only applies to developers/xcode source installs)\r\n- Enumeration type menu options UI\r\n- FPS debug label now includes total CPU and Memory usage.\r\n- GameBoy Advanced cheat code support\r\n- Jaguar options exposed\r\n- Long press a ROM for quick access to Core Options\r\n- Mednafen\r\n  - many more sub-core options added\r\n  - SNESFaust 1 frame render ahead option (on by default. VERY SNAPPY!)\r\n- Metal Shaders (CRT, LCD, etc.)\r\n- N64:\r\n  - mupen/gliden/rice options exposed\r\n  - Dual Shock 4 touchpad as pause\r\n  - option for Dual Joysticks on DualShock4 as dual controllers (allows Goldeneye dual controller joystick layout from 1 physical dualshock)\r\n- Native Metal renderer option [WIP/Buggy]\r\n- per-game option overrides\r\n- radio selection options\r\n- Sega Saturn Mutli-CD support\r\n- Swift UI/UIKit optional code paths at app start (SwiftUI currernly empty, for easier development in future)\r\n- VirtualBoy side by side mode (for 3D tv's with Side by Side mode. Google Cardboard coming later)\r\n- XCode will present a warning message if it detects a device build but CodeSigning.xcconfig isn't setup.\r\n- Localizations (Only Partially translated WIP)\r\n  - NSLocalizedString for most strings in main app source\r\n  - Chinese Simplified by  @nenge123\r\n  - Spanish\r\n  - Russian by  @amoorecodes\r\n  - Dutch by @mrjschulte\r\n  - Portuguese (Brazil) by  St\u00e9fano Santos\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n\r\n- Mupen:\r\n  - wrapper code organized, refactored\r\n  - faster controller polling, various other code speedup tweaks.\r\n  - mupen llvm optimization flags improved (was incorrectly -O2, now -Os)\r\n- On-Screen Controls\r\n  - N64 layout improved\r\n  - PSX layout improved\r\n- Branch prediction compiler hints for tight loops, possibly faster.\r\n- Catalyst: All cores build now for Intel and M1.\r\n- check if file exists before attempt to delete, reduces superfluous throws trapping in the debugger\r\n- Converted more app code from ObjC to Swift\r\n- Dark Mode UI always on, fixes some color issues\r\n- Fix some excessive thread blocks\r\n- Hide/Show systems chevron location tweaks\r\n- If multiple cores support a system, cores are listed in recommended order.\r\n- Improved logo/header bar for iOS & tvOS\r\n- Jaguar button layout tweaks\r\n- Mark various ObjC classes `objc_direct_members`. Should improve Swift to ObjC calls bypassing dynamic dispatch for function pointers (in theory)\r\n- Replace all spinlocks with atomic operations for better thread performance\r\n- replaced some sloppy force unwraps with proper nil checks and logging\r\n- Shaders are copied to Documents at load and read from thereafter. This allows locally editing / developing shaders without rebuilding.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- Conflicts better detected\r\n- tvOS top buttons sometimes couldn't be selected\r\n- Faster compile times (improved header imports, compiler flags)\r\n- Fixed some improper retain cycles in ObjC blocks\r\n- Fixed rare audio engine nil reference race condition crash\r\n- Cheat entry UI fixes\r\n\r\n### Updated\r\n\r\n- N64:\r\n  - Swap left and right triggers to L:Start R:Z Button from other way around prior\r\n  - mupen cxd4 plugin to latest upstream version\r\n  - mupen rsp-hle plugin to latest upstream version\r\n- Updated Swift Packages (RxRealm, Realm, Cocoalumberjack)\r\n- Improved tvOS UI (top buttons, search, icons, more consistent styling)\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n- Removed SteamController support (no one used it and the code caused too many compilations, plus steam controllers are kind of trash, sorry.)\r\n",

Install [RespringApp](https://github.com/jailbreakdotparty/dirtyZero/releases/download/respringapp/respringapp.ipa) using your preferred method of sideloading. If you signed RespringApp with PPQ Protection or AltStore/SideStore, enable \"Change Respring App Bundle ID\" in settings and type in the bundle id of RespringApp. You can find the bundle id in AltStore's/SideStore's \"View App IDs\" menu or with tools like [Antrag](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Antrag).\n2. In dirtyZero, click the orange \"Respring\" button.\n3. Profit \ud83d\udd25\n\n*This method brought to you by [`@nyaathea`](https://x.com/nyaathea). Due to the nature of the method, it is not possible to integrate this directly into the dirtyZero app, hence the seperate IPA. Note that you can also simply click the RespringApp application itself to respring.*\n\n**Option 2: Display & Text Size**\n1. Before applying the tweaks, go into Settings > Display & Brightness > Display Zoom\n2. Pick the option that's opposite of the one you're currently using.\n3. After, apply the tweaks.\n4. Go back into Settings > Display & Brightness > Display Zoom\n5. Pick the option that's opposite of the one you're currently using.\n\n\n# Credits\n- [Skadz](https://github.com/skadz108) for making this app.\n- [lunginspector](https://github.com/lunginspector) for the UI and numerous tweaks.\n- Ian Beer of Google Project Zero for discovering and publishing the exploit.\n",

                    "localizedDescription": "This is the fourth revision of beta 8.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* The Dolphin core has been updated to 2412.\r\n  * Save states made in previous beta versions are not compatible. GameCube memory cards and Wii in-game save files are not affected.\r\n* Added new app icons based off the macOS icon introduced in Dolphin 2407. (thanks Kongolabongo and @brand175 for the new iOS icons, and thanks MayImilae for the original macOS icon)\r\n* No JIT mode (**very slow**) has been added. (thanks @brand175)\r\n  * When launching a game without JIT enabled, you can now choose to start it in No JIT mode.\r\n  * The \"waiting for JIT\" screen can be bypassed entirely by manually changing the CPU Emulation Engine in Settings -> Config -> Advanced to Cached Interpreter.\r\n  * No JIT mode is **very slow**. You will need a high-end device (like a recent iPhone or iPad Pro) and to enable speed hacks (VBI Skip, CPU underclock, etc) to achieve playable speeds.\r\n* Added a button to import BootMii NAND backups in the software list.\r\n  * This is useful for those who want to play Wiimmfi online.\r\n  * No JIT users beware: Wiimmfi will ban devices that run below 100% emulation speed in Mario Kart Wii. We recommend that Wiimmfi should only be used in JIT mode.\r\n* Added experimental support for rootless jailbreaks. \r\n* Added a menu to check which buttons are being pressed on physical controllers when mapping buttons.\r\n* Ported \"Respect Silent Mode\" toggle from Delta.\r\n  * This setting controls whether DolphiniOS obeys the Ring/Silent switch on your device. If disabled, then audio will play even if silent mode is enabled.\r\n  * Find it in Settings -> Config -> Audio.  \r\n* Added Game Mode for devices running iOS 18.\r\n* Re-implemented the touch screen Wii pointer.\r\n  * A new default mode has been added: \"drag\". This mode allows you to use your touch screen like a laptop trackpad when moving the Wii pointer.\r\n  * The mode used in 3.2.1 and earlier is still available as \"follow\" mode.\r\n  * Choose the mode you want as default in the top bar menu during emulation or in Settings -> Controllers -> Touchscreen.\r\n* Re-implemented automatic disc changing.\r\n  * When a game asks for a different disc, DolphiniOS will automatically insert the correct disc into the emulated disc drive.\r\n  * Both disc files must be imported (i.e. in the Software folder and visible in the software list) for this feature to work properly.\r\n  * If it still does not work, ensure that \"Change Disc Automatically\" is enabled in Settings -> Config -> General.\r\n* Re-implemented the touch screen transparency level slider.\r\n* Re-implemented support for multiple save state slots.\r\n* Re-implemented the Open button in the software list.\r\n* Re-implemented the Delete button in the software list.\r\n* Re-implemented the Launch GameCube Main Menu button in the software list.\r\n* Matched the refresh rate of the `MTKView` to the display's refresh rate.\r\n  * GameCube and Wii games do not run above 30/60Hz.\r\n  * This is only for testing purposes.\r\n* Fixed many crashes, freezes, physics bugs, etc when using Cached Interpreter.\r\n  * The fix for this bug (disabling \"fast math\" mode in Xcode) will likely result in a slight performance decrease.\r\n  * While fast math does make math calculations run faster, it also causes [some calculations to return incorrect answers](https://simonbyrne.github.io/notes/fastmath/).\r\n  * Accuracy is vital when emulating software. When fast math returns a wrong answer for a calculation, it can cause crashing and other bugs in the emulated software, as they always expect to receive correct answers.\r\n  * For example, the Wii's System Menu immediately crashes when using Cached Interpreter in previous 4.0.0 beta builds, as the math used to calculate whether the pointer is hovering over a channel or not returns incorrect results. Disabling fast math fixes this issue.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the bottom of the \"waiting for JIT\" screen was cut off on some devices. (thanks @brand175)\r\n* Fixed an issue where booting Wii software during the first launch of the app could cause DolphiniOS to crash.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the state of the \"Enabled\" switch in the menu shown when mapping controller buttons does not save properly.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the toggle for VBI Skip in Settings was still using its old name, VI Skip.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the top bar could get dismissed while using the menu.\r\n  * This was fixed by removing the code which dismissed the top bar after 5 seconds.\r\n  * You now need to manually dismiss the top bar by pressing the \"eye with a slash through it\" icon.\r\n  * Unfortunately, there is no way to check to see if the menu is open, so this was the best solution I could come up with. \r\n* Fixed an issue where the software list was not refreshed when importing new software.\r\n* Fixed an issue where device motion did not apply to the Nunchuk.\r\n  * Users who are updating from an older beta version will need to re-import the Touchscreen default profile in Controllers to apply this bug fix.\r\n* Hid some options in the debug menu when DolphiniOS is built in release mode. \r\n* Updated MoltenVK to 1.2.8.\r\n  * [The latest version of MoltenVK is incompatible with Dolphin due to a bug](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/issues/2403).\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\n* Revision 2 was released shortly after the initial revision was published.\r\n  * Fixed a problem with the build creation process which caused builds to not show up on GitHub.\r\n* Revision 3 was released on Jan 17.\r\n  * Fixed a problem with the app icon not showing up on SpringBoard.\r\n  * Fixed a problem where the version number was not updated to beta 8.\r\n  * Fixed a problem where using Vulkan would cause colours to appear oversaturated until the app was restarted. (thanks @brand175)\r\n* Revision 4 was released shortly after Revision 3.\r\n  * Fixed a problem where the touch screen controller button images were not included in the app.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/OatmealDome/dolphin-ios/compare/v4.0.0b7...v4.0.0b8",

You\u2019ll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.\n\nReddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular communities are:\n\u2022 r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions\n\u2022 r/funny, which is full of humorous content\n\u2022 r/science, for scientific discussions and news\n\u2022 r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure\n\nOn Reddit you\u2019ll find:\n\u2022 Thousands of community groups\nBreaking news, social media trends, sports highlights, TV fan theories, open AI discussions and personalized content, there's a community for everyone.\n\n\u2022 Loads of laughs\nFind memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time.\n\n\u2022 AMAs, or \"Ask Me Anything\"\nCelebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.\n\n\u2022 The best discussions on any topic\nReddit\u2019s discussion threads are where community members jump in with humor and insights for just about anything; pop culture, sports, entertainment, or financial advice.\n\n\u2022 Get answers to anonymous questions \nAsk communities anything you want. Ask questions on relationships, mental health, parenting, career help, fitness plans, and more.\n\n\u2022 Anonymous profiles so you can do YOU\nConnect with people about any topic, join interactive community groups or threads, and chat with other redditors, all anonymously.\n\nVoting and Karma:\n\nInstead of likes and hearts, Reddit\u2019s social network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator\u2019s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.\n\nWhile karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts\u2019 visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent spam or low-quality content.",

                    "localizedDescription": "# \u26a0\ufe0fThis version \u26a0\ufe0fREQUIRES\u26a0\ufe0f SideStore 0.6.2+ / AltStore 2.2.1+ to install.\r\n>[!Note]\r\n> Yes, as heralded in the 3.5.0 release, and due to the removal of Store patching, SideStore 0.6.2+ / AltStore 2.2.1+ is required to install this version of LiveContainer. You can use \"Import/Refresh Certificate from AltStore/SideStore\" button to setup JIT-Less mode.\r\n\r\nThis version of LiveContainer focuses on quality-of-life improvements, new features such as app sorting and enhanced multitasking, as well as various bug fixes.\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n\r\n## New Icon\r\n1. LiveContainer/LiveContainer2 now has a new HD icon and supports dark and tinted modes. By @m1337v.\r\n\r\n## Multitasking\r\n1. A dock has been added for multitasking mode. The dock can be hidden by dragging it to the edge of the screen, and collapsed by tapping the collapse button. You can also resize the dock in the settings. By @boa-z.\r\n2. In windowed multitasking mode, you can now maximize or minimize windows using buttons on the new window bar. By @boa-z.\r\n3. When maximized, the window will occupy the safe area. Additionally, if the dock is collapsed, the entire window bar will be hidden, allowing the app to take up the full screen.\r\n4. You can now place the window bar at the bottom of the window.\r\n5. Windows will now automatically resize when the device is rotated.\r\n6. You can now choose whether to automatically exit Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode when returning to LiveContainer. This option is available in the LiveContainer settings.\r\n7. The window hosting PiP is now automatically hidden, and is restored when dismissing PiP.\r\n\r\n## App Management\r\n1. You can now double-tap an app to quickly open its settings. By @m1337v.\r\n2. Apps can now be sorted by name (A\u2013Z, Z\u2013A), last opened date, installation date, or a custom order, allowing you to arrange them however you like. By @boa-z and @m1337v.\r\n3. You can now view an app's installation date and last launch date in its settings.\r\n\r\n## [EXPERIMENTAL] Built-in SideStore\r\nThis experimental feature combines both LiveContainer and SideStore into a single app, saving one app slot for other standalone apps. You can try it out by downloading \"LiveContainer+SideStore.ipa\". Currently, SideStore itself, the refresh shortcut, and the widget are functional. See here for all changes made to original SideStore https://github.com/hugeBlack/SideStore/tree/LiveContainerSupport\r\n\r\n> [!Note]\r\n> LiveProcess is required to use the refresh shortcut.\r\n> It has been reported that the built-in SideStore cannot determine the device UDID if the standalone SideStore is running in the background. If you encounter this issue, please terminate the standalone SideStore.\r\n\r\n> [!Warning]  \r\n> Logging into built-in SideStore will save your credentials to LiveContainer's keychain access group. Even though LiveContainer implements isolated keychain access, it is not guaranteed to be completely bulletproof. As such, malicious apps may be able to extract credentials from built-in SideStore. Please consider migrating to a burner Apple ID if you tend to install apps from unknown sources.\r\n\r\n# Improvements\r\n\r\n## App Switching Between LiveContainer/LiveContainer2/LiveProcess\r\nWe\u2019ve implemented a new method to directly check whether LiveContainer or LiveContainer2 is running, enabling more accurate detection of running apps. In this version, LiveContainer will automatically switch to a running app or launch an app using an idle LiveContainer.\r\n\r\n## UserDefaults/Preferences\r\nWe've adopted a new UserDefaults/Preferences hook that is more efficient and capable of redirecting more preference reads/writes to the app\u2019s container.\r\n\r\n## Language Switching\r\nWe\u2019ve introduced a new language switching mechanism that now also applies to LiveProcess without affecting LiveContainer\u2019s own language settings.\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n1. Fixed an issue where some apps displayed a black screen in versions 3.5.0/3.5.1. Fixes #543, #594.\r\n2. Fixed an issue where some apps bypassed `SecItem*` hooks using `dlsym`. Fix #339.\r\n3. Fixed issues with signing and patching apps when the app's main executable header was nearly full, by skipping certain patches. Fixes #606, #608.\r\n4. Fixed physical keyboard input not working in multitasking mode. Fix #524.\r\n5. Fixed a crash caused by receiving malformed OCSP responses. Fix #617.\r\n6. Fixed a crash caused by signals being converted to SIGKILL when TPRO switched to read-only mode. TPRO is now switched to read-only only after overwriting the main executable path. Fixes #310, #519.\r\n7. Fixed an issue where some apps couldn\u2019t store UserDefaults by implementing a new UserDefaults hook. Fix #633.\r\n9. Fixed a crash in some apps due to symbol name conflicts with system symbols on iOS 26, by preloading affected libraries. Fix #667.\r\n10. We adopted a new method to mitigate an issue where some apps were being killed in the background with code 0xdead10cc.\r\n\r\n# Removed Features\r\n1. **Store patching**: This has been removed. Please use the \"Import Certificate from SideStore/AltStore\" button instead.\r\n2. **Fix black screen**: This is no longer needed, as the underlying issue has been resolved.\r\n3. **Retrieve data from LiveProcess**: This feature has been removed since we can now accurately detect whether LiveProcess is running.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\nThanks @CelloSerenity @a1exsDev @bachig26 for fixing typo/building script/repo files.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to the following contributors for continuing to update translations:\r\n- **Traditional Chinese** \u2014 Jack Black  \r\n- **Italian** \u2014 @Checkm8ra1n  \r\n- **Turkish** \u2014 @sekertr  \r\n- **Vietnamese** \u2014 @khanhduytran0  \r\n- **Portuguese** \u2014 @DaniTrox  \r\n- **Arabic** \u2014 dlshad2  \r\n- **French** \u2014 @p-sage  \r\n- **German** \u2014 @BeityBytes  \r\n- **Japanese** \u2014 @naolad  \r\n- **Swedish** \u2014 @se2crid",

This update brings powerful new features like multitasking and better ADP certificate support, along with several bug fixes, improvements, and new language translations.\r\n\r\n# Multitasking\r\nOne of LiveContainer\u2019s main limitations has been the inability to open more than one app at a time. Our new multitasking feature addresses that.\r\n\r\nYou can now launch multiple apps simultaneously in in-app virtual windows. These windows can be resized, scaled, and even displayed using the native Picture-in-Picture (PiP) feature. On iPads, apps can run in native window mode, displaying each app in a separate system window.\r\n\r\nAnd if you wish, you can choose to run apps in multitasking mode by default in settings.\r\n\r\nTo use multitasking:\r\n1. Convert the app you want to multitask into a **shared app**.\r\n2. Hold its banner and tap **\"Multitask\"**.\r\n\r\n>[!Note]\r\n>1. To use multitasking, ensure you select **\"Keep Extension\"** when installing via SideStore/AltStore.  \r\n>2. Most common apps are compatible, but some may have issues.  \r\n>3. If you want to enable JIT for multitasked apps, you\u2019ll need a JIT enabler that supports attaching by PID \u2014 coming soon in StikDebug.\r\n\r\n# ADP Certificate Support\r\nLiveContainer now officially supports ADP development certificates. Thanks to PR #537 by @SoY0ung, LiveContainer uses the app group included in your `.mobileprovision` file, rather than hard-coded SideStore/AltStore app groups. This unlocks multitasking and other features.\r\n\r\n>[!Note]\r\n>1. Only **development certificates** are supported.  \r\n>2. To use multitasking, your `.mobileprovision` must contain at least one app group. \r\n>3. To enable keychain separation, LiveContainer must be signed with all 128 required keychain access groups.  \r\n>4. We recommend changing LiveContainer's bundle ID to match the `application-identifier` in your `.mobileprovision`.\r\n\r\n# iOS 26 Liquid Glass Support\r\nAlthough LiveContainer is currently built with iOS 18.2 SDK, we include an option to enable Liquid Glass for LiveContainer's UI if you have upgraded to iOS 26. You can find this option in iOS Settings-> Apps -> LiveContainer -> enable Liquid Glass.\r\n\r\n# Improvements\r\n- Optimized app launching process for faster startup:\r\n  - No longer moves shared app data to a private folder.\r\n  - Uses a new method to override the main executable path, avoiding SIGSEGV signal handlers.\r\n  - Removed app lock and use container lock only.\r\n- Added `.tipa` support (#467). Note: this allows installing `.tipa` files, but does not mean the app will run properly without correct entitlements.\r\n- You can now search for apps in the app list.\r\n- Renamed StikJIT (Standalone) to StikDebug.\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed #200 by directly setting `dyld.config.process.mainExecutablePath` to app's real main executable path, ensuring `_NSGetExecutablePath` returns the correct value.\r\n- Fixed #326 by correcting an error in `Info.plist`. Note: HealthKit entitlements are still required to access health data.\r\n- Alleviate #423 by avoiding dyld library validation bypass on signed apps, which otherwise prevents apps that requires JIT from executing JIT pages on A15+\r\n- Fixed #478 by moving the JIT enabling window to `LCAppListView`.\r\n- Fixed #476 by updating ZSign.\r\n- Fixed #497 by resolving an issue in dyld library validation bypass.\r\n- Fixed iOS 16.2 (#495) and iOS 18.4+ on iPad 7 (#531).\r\n- Fixed #518 by sending KVO notifications when UsedDefaults is changed.\r\n- Fixed #582 by invalidating duplicate library load commands.\r\n\r\n# Deprecated Features\r\n## SideStore/AltStore Patching\r\nWith SideStore 0.6.2-20250420.25 and AltStore 2.2.1 both supporting certificate export, patching these stores is no longer necessary. This feature is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.\r\n\r\n# Translations\r\nThanks to our community translators, LiveContainer now supports:\r\n\r\n- **Traditional Chinese** \u2014 Jack Black  \r\n- **Italian** \u2014 @Checkm8ra1n  \r\n- **Turkish** \u2014 @sekertr  \r\n- **Vietnamese** \u2014 @khanhduytran0  \r\n- **Portuguese** \u2014 @DaniTrox  \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to the following contributors for continuing to update translations:\r\n- **Arabic** \u2014 dlshad2  \r\n- **French** \u2014 @p-sage  \r\n- **German** \u2014 @BeityBytes  \r\n- **Japanese** \u2014 @naolad  \r\n- **Swedish** \u2014 @se2crid\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\nShout out to @khanhduytran0 for doing a lot of research under the hood which made the multitasking feature possible! \r\nGreat thanks to @neoarz for providing us certificates so we can test support for ADP certificate!",

Fortunately we have developed the \"Spoof SDK Version\" feature, forcing system libraries to operate in the SDK version the app is built with. You can enable \"Spoof SDK Version\".\r\n\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n## 1. New Re-Sign Strategy\r\nInstead of keeping track of expiration date, LiveContainer now directly ask iOS to determine whether the code signature is valid, which significantly decreases app re-sign rate. For now your apps will be re-signed only if their code signature is invalid, which probably happens when your certificate is expired (usually takes a year), or is revoked (when you reinstall SideStore/AltStore).\r\n\r\n## 2. Support for StikJIT(StikDebug), SideStore JIT\r\n [StikJIT(StikDebug)](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikJIT) is the newest on-device JIT enabler powered by [idevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice). You can now install it both as a standalone app or install it inside LiveContainer. See #265 item 5.8 for more information.\r\n\r\nSideStore has recently switched its backend to idevice and added on-device JIT support. For now its JIT URL Scheme has not been implemented so you have to manually enable JIT for LiveContainer.\r\n\r\n## 3. Spoof SDK version\r\nSpoofing SDK version forces system libraries to operate in the SDK version the app is built with. This fix works surprisingly well so we decided to enable it by default for newly installed apps. This fixes some old apps crashing because of the new SDK. We also removed the \"Bypass AssertBarrierOnQueue\" fix since the root cause is SDK version.\r\n\r\nFix #421 #422\r\n\r\n## 4. Support Import Certificate From SideStore\r\nWith [this SideStore pr](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/pull/959), we can now directly retrieve certificate from SideStore (0.6.2-20250420.25+) without the patch, thus simplifying the process of enabling JIT-Less mode.\r\n\r\n## 5. Game Mode Support\r\nWith the SDK version upgrade, LiveContainer now supports game mode. If you don't need it, you can turn it off in the control center. \r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n1. Fix a regression caused by NSBundle path fix. Fix #409\r\n2. Keep app's plugin folder in case some apps need files inside. Fix hugeBlack/LiveContainer#43\r\n3. Add TPRO rw in overwrite exec path in case the executable path is TPRO protected. Fix #327\r\n4. Replace all `withCheckedContinuation` with `withUnsafeContinuation` to solve crash on iOS 18.0 beta. Fix #435\r\n5. Add file permission to solve some sign issues. Fix #448\r\n\r\n# Removed Features\r\nThe following features are removed because it's not useful in current version or constantly causing issues.\r\n1. AltSign: We drop AltSign support because it's constantly causing issues and it's relatively old.\r\n2. Bypass AssertBarrierOnQueue: It is replaced by \"Spoof SDK version\"\r\n3. Sign Only on Signature Expires: It's now useless as we directly determine if an app's code signature is valid by asking the system.\r\n\r\n# Translation\r\nLiveContainer is now translated into Arabic, Simplified Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese and Swedish\r\n- Arabic: translated by dlshad2\r\n- French: translated by @p-sage\r\n- German: translated by @BeityBytes\r\n- Japanese: translated by @naolad\r\n- Portuguese: translated by damn_the_daniel\r\n- Swedish: translated by @se2crid\r\n\r\n# Credit\r\nShout out to @khanhduytran0 for doing a lot of research under the hood!\r\n\r\n# Other\r\nLiveContainer is now migrated from a Theos project to a Xcode project, which simplifies the development and significantly decreased Github Actions build time (2 minutes now and around 10 minutes previously)",

Additionally, we have changed some confusing text.\r\n\r\n>[!Note]\r\nDue to a change of LiveContainer's entitlement and a bug with SideStore/AltStore, SideStore 0.6.0+ / AltStore 2.0+ is **required** to install LiveContainer 3.3.0\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n## Install from URL / Share Sheet\r\nYou can now install apps directly from a URL by using the plus button on the \"My Apps\" page or by using an install URL like `livecontainer://install?url=xxxxxxx`. Additionally, you can share an IPA file directly from other apps via the share sheet. (Please note that iOS may hide LiveContainer in the \"More\" section\u2014simply tap \"More\" and scroll down to find it.)\r\n## Share File to Guest Apps\r\nFiles can now be shared to guest apps when they are running through the share sheet.\r\n\r\nImplement #320\r\n\r\n## JITStreamer-EB Support\r\n[JITStreamer-EB](https://jkcoxson.com/jitstreamer) is now available in LiveContainer. To use it:\r\n- Set it up first in JITStreamer-EB's website\r\n- Go to LiveContainer settings->JIT Enabler->Select JITStreamer-EB. You can leave the \"Address\" blank if you are using official server and it's default to `http://[fd00::]:9172`.\r\n- Long press the app that needs JIT->Settings->enable Launch with JIT->Tap Run, LiveContainer will contact the server and enable JIT for that app.\r\n\r\n>[!Note]\r\nJIT is broken in iOS 18.4 Beta 1, please avoid this version.\r\n\r\n## \"Entitlement File\" Section in JITLess Diagnose\r\nThe \"Entitlement File\" section is now available in the JITLess Diagnose page, making it easier and more accurate to diagnose issues with your JITLess setup.\r\n\r\n## Personal Certificate Support (Untestsed)\r\nLiveContainer can now be used without SideStore/AltStore if you import the certificate used to sign it. Please note that for LiveContainer to work correctly, some changes must be made to the bundle and entitlement:\r\n- The bundle ID must match the one in the .mobileprovision file without a prefix.\r\n- LiveContainer must be signed with the get-task-allow=true entitlement, meaning Enterprise certificates will not work.\r\n- To use the keychain separation feature, LiveContainer must be signed with the correct entitlement. Please refer to entitlements.xml for the required keychain access groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can check these criteria in Settings->JITLess Diagnose->Entitlement File. All items except com.apple.security.application-groups should be green.\r\n\r\nImplement #54 #64 #231\r\n\r\n## Up to 128 Containers Per App\r\nWith the release of SideStore 0.6.0, which fixes the entitlement issue with Keychain Access Groups, you can now create up to 128 containers for each app. Each container created in version 3.3.0 will be assigned a random Keychain Access Group to prevent crashes caused by Keychain Access Group collisions.\r\n\r\n## Hide LiveContainer\r\nTo bypass some app's injection detection, 3 following options are added to app-specific settings.\r\n- Hide LiveContainer from Dyld Api\r\n- Don't Inject TweakLoader\r\n- Don't Load TweakLoader\r\n\r\nFor most apps, enabling the first two options should be sufficient to bypass injection detection. However, please note that if TweakLoader is not loaded, some features (like app fast switching) may not be available.\r\n\r\nFix #146 #338\r\n\r\n## Archive Option when Installing 2nd LiveContainer\r\nYou can now archive the second LiveContainer instead of installing it directly, allowing you to customize it as needed.\r\n\r\n## URL to Launch to LiveContainer's UI\r\nYou can now use `livecontainer://livecontainer-launch?bundle-name=ui`to launch to LiveContainer's UI\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix #314: Frameworks in the tweaks folder are now signed and injected correctly.\r\n- Fix #318: Resolved an issue in fishhook that caused crashes when handling invalid `symtab_index`.\r\n- Fix #332: Fixed a dyld issue where the wrong image was being used when dyld functions were hooked.\r\n- Fix #329: Insert `LC_ID_DYLIB` load command to resolve segment-related issues.\r\n- Fix #358 #374: Dopamine's dyld patch is taken into account when bypassing dyld library validation.\r\n- Fix #381: LiveContainer can correctly close itself when it is hidden.\r\n- Fix #384: All settings are correctly copied when replacing app.\r\n- Fixed UI issues when the \"Button Shape\" accessibility setting was enabled.\r\n- Improved some previously confusing or misleading text.",

Please refer to the \"Black Screen Fix\" section below for more details.\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n## Black Screen Fix\r\nThe Black Screen Fix is no longer applied automatically to prevent loading `UIKit.framework` before the app\u2019s main executable is opened, which could cause symbol binding issues. You can enable it in Long press app -> Settings -> enable Fix Black Screen\r\n\r\n## App Group Isolation\r\nYou can now isolate app groups for different containers, allowing multiple accounts (e.g., in SideStore) to be signed in within separate containers. You can find files inside app group in container folder -> LCAppGroup\r\n\r\nYou can enable this feature by: Long press app -> Settings -> (Container name) -> enable Isolate App Group\r\nFix #279\r\n\r\n## Open URL Automatically\r\nYou can now automatically open an URL in current app without being prompted.\r\nImplement #285 \r\n\r\n## Ignore Error During dlopen\r\nThis fixes errors like `dlsym(xxxx, xxxx)` caused by app's initializers calling dlsym with a non-existing symbol\r\n\r\nFix issues like #124\r\n\r\n## Better App Signature Check\r\nThe team ID used in app signing is now considered when determining if an app needs re-signing. This allows apps to be re-signed if they are transferred between LiveContainers installed by different Apple IDs.\r\n\r\n## JIT-Less Mode Diagnose Page & LiveContainer Help\r\nA new JIT-Less Mode Diagnose Page helps new users quickly identify configuration issues. Problematic items are highlighted in red for easy troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nYou can see this page in Settings -> JIT-Less Mode Diagnose.\r\nYou can see LiveContainer help in Apps -> ? Button\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes & Compatibility\r\n## Separate App-Specific Settings from Info.plist\r\nApp-Specific Settings is now saved in a different file to prevent app from crashing due to reading it.\r\n\r\nFix #277\r\n\r\n## Hook dlsym(RTLD_MAIN_ONLY,xxx)\r\nRedirect this call to the app's main executable instead of LiveContainer's to prevent issues.\r\n\r\nFix #124 #130 #140 #221 #225\r\n\r\n## Don't Link against UIKit.framework\r\n*This solution is provided by khanhduytran0*\r\n`UIKit.framework` is now not linked by LiveContainer's main executable to prevent symbol binding issues. However this will prevent the black screen fix to be automatically applied.\r\n\r\nFix #277 #272 #200 #139\r\n\r\n## App Hiding Without Device Password\r\nApp hiding now works even if the device doesn\u2019t have a password set.\r\n\r\nFix #281\r\n\r\n## (Regression) Fix 2 Bugs in NSUserDefaultsHook in 3.1.0\r\nFix #276 #291\r\n\r\n## Fix long press actions of last guest app remain\r\nFix #235\r\n\r\n## Fix Apps Unable to Open Their Own URL Schemes\r\nFix #44\r\n\r\n## Resolve Crash Loop with Blank `Info.plist`\r\nHandles cases where `Info.plist` is blank due to app corruption, which previously crashes LiveContainerSwiftUI.\r\nFix #293\r\n\r\n## Fix CallKit Unable to Initialize \r\nFix #258\r\n\r\n## Fix Crash when Patching Store\r\nThe cause of this issue is that LiveContainer cannot access App Group due to incorrect setup.",

You can switch signer in Settings and app-specific settings for one specific app.\r\n\r\n## Re-Sign Only on Expiration\r\nLiveContainer now keeps track of the date of expiration of each app's code signature and only signs when its signature is expired. So re-signing happens less frequent than before.\r\n\r\n## Automatic Tweak Re-Sign\r\nLiveContainer now keeps track of the tweaks you added and re-signs it if it is changed or its code signature expires, which makes tweak development with LiveContainer more convenient.\r\n\r\nImplement #175.\r\n\r\n## Multiple Container Support\r\nYou can now create up to 3 containers for each app, so you can log in multiple accounts in different containers(data folders).\r\n\r\nKeychains are now semi-separated between app containers. Note that keychains will be removed if you delete a container in LiveContainer.\r\n\r\nkeychains created in older version will remain untouched so you can continue using your apps like before. To use this feature, clean up your keychain in LiveContainer settings.\r\n\r\nThis feature, along with the following fix of NSUserDefault leak impelements #218 #176.\r\n\r\n## Language Selection for Each App\r\nYou can now choose an language for an app in app-specific settings.\r\n\r\nImplement #171\r\n\r\n## App Preferences\r\nYou can now modify app preferences in LiveContainer like in iOS Settings. To change app preferences, go to app-specific settings -> (container name) -> Container Preferences\r\n\r\nImplement #252\r\n\r\n## Force Orientation Lock\r\nThis option can be used to solve some game having stretched/mal-functioning UI when launched in portrait mode\r\n\r\nImplement #251\r\n\r\n## JITLess Support for Multiple SideStores\r\nIf you use Multiple SideStores with SparseRestore, you can now export the tweaked SideStore IPA and install it manually to enable JITLess mode.\r\n\r\nImplement #219\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- **NSUserDefault Leak & Random Signing out**: NSUserDefault(app preferences) are now *almost* separated and properly placed in app's data folder. Solve #149 #163 #215\r\n- **Game Controller Support**: You can now use game controllers in LiveContainer\r\n- **Hook `-[VSSubscriptionRegistrationCenter setCurrentSubscription:]`**: Solve #227\r\n- **New file picker & local notification fix**\r\n- **App receiving LiveContainer's launch URL after launch**: Solve #243\r\n",

App and their data, Keychains and most preferences can be shared between these two. If user open an app via URL Scheme or from My Apps screen, the LiveContainer that last ran that app will be switched to.\r\n\r\n### Better Open in App Support (#153)\r\nIt turns out that some apps don't rely on URL Schemes and use Universal Links instead. In this update, the web page's `apple-app-site-association` will be checked and LiveContainer will launch app based on it.\r\n\r\n### Localization (#153)\r\nLocalization is now supported. You can add a language in LiveContainerSwiftUI project and add your translation in `Localizable.xcstrings`, then submit your translation as PR. We may consider adding something like a Crowdin page if it\u2019s large enough (?)\r\n\r\n### Dedicated AltStore/SideStore source (#156)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n### iOS file picker issue (#153): #68, #123, #142\r\n\r\n### Duplicated Flutter-based app bundle name (#153): #112\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\nI'd like to thank @hugeBlack a lot for covering most of this update (#153), and thank @Staubgeborener for #156",

You can use \"Import/Refresh Certificate from AltStore/SideStore\" button to setup JIT-Less mode.\r\n\r\nThis version of LiveContainer focuses on quality-of-life improvements, new features such as app sorting and enhanced multitasking, as well as various bug fixes.\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n\r\n## New Icon\r\n1. LiveContainer/LiveContainer2 now has a new HD icon and supports dark and tinted modes. By @m1337v.\r\n\r\n## Multitasking\r\n1. A dock has been added for multitasking mode. The dock can be hidden by dragging it to the edge of the screen, and collapsed by tapping the collapse button. You can also resize the dock in the settings. By @boa-z.\r\n2. In windowed multitasking mode, you can now maximize or minimize windows using buttons on the new window bar. By @boa-z.\r\n3. When maximized, the window will occupy the safe area. Additionally, if the dock is collapsed, the entire window bar will be hidden, allowing the app to take up the full screen.\r\n4. You can now place the window bar at the bottom of the window.\r\n5. Windows will now automatically resize when the device is rotated.\r\n6. You can now choose whether to automatically exit Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode when returning to LiveContainer. This option is available in the LiveContainer settings.\r\n7. The window hosting PiP is now automatically hidden, and is restored when dismissing PiP.\r\n\r\n## App Management\r\n1. You can now double-tap an app to quickly open its settings. By @m1337v.\r\n2. Apps can now be sorted by name (A\u2013Z, Z\u2013A), last opened date, installation date, or a custom order, allowing you to arrange them however you like. By @boa-z and @m1337v.\r\n3. You can now view an app's installation date and last launch date in its settings.\r\n\r\n## [EXPERIMENTAL] Built-in SideStore\r\nThis experimental feature combines both LiveContainer and SideStore into a single app, saving one app slot for other standalone apps. You can try it out by downloading \"LiveContainer+SideStore.ipa\". Currently, SideStore itself, the refresh shortcut, and the widget are functional. See here for all changes made to original SideStore https://github.com/hugeBlack/SideStore/tree/LiveContainerSupport\r\n\r\n> [!Note]\r\n> LiveProcess is required to use the refresh shortcut.\r\n> It has been reported that the built-in SideStore cannot determine the device UDID if the standalone SideStore is running in the background. If you encounter this issue, please terminate the standalone SideStore.\r\n\r\n> [!Warning]  \r\n> Logging into built-in SideStore will save your credentials to LiveContainer's keychain access group. Even though LiveContainer implements isolated keychain access, it is not guaranteed to be completely bulletproof. As such, malicious apps may be able to extract credentials from built-in SideStore. Please consider migrating to a burner Apple ID if you tend to install apps from unknown sources.\r\n\r\n# Improvements\r\n\r\n## App Switching Between LiveContainer/LiveContainer2/LiveProcess\r\nWe\u2019ve implemented a new method to directly check whether LiveContainer or LiveContainer2 is running, enabling more accurate detection of running apps. In this version, LiveContainer will automatically switch to a running app or launch an app using an idle LiveContainer.\r\n\r\n## UserDefaults/Preferences\r\nWe've adopted a new UserDefaults/Preferences hook that is more efficient and capable of redirecting more preference reads/writes to the app\u2019s container.\r\n\r\n## Language Switching\r\nWe\u2019ve introduced a new language switching mechanism that now also applies to LiveProcess without affecting LiveContainer\u2019s own language settings.\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n1. Fixed an issue where some apps displayed a black screen in versions 3.5.0/3.5.1. Fixes #543, #594.\r\n2. Fixed an issue where some apps bypassed `SecItem*` hooks using `dlsym`. Fix #339.\r\n3. Fixed issues with signing and patching apps when the app's main executable header was nearly full, by skipping certain patches. Fixes #606, #608.\r\n4. Fixed physical keyboard input not working in multitasking mode. Fix #524.\r\n5. Fixed a crash caused by receiving malformed OCSP responses. Fix #617.\r\n6. Fixed a crash caused by signals being converted to SIGKILL when TPRO switched to read-only mode. TPRO is now switched to read-only only after overwriting the main executable path. Fixes #310, #519.\r\n7. Fixed an issue where some apps couldn\u2019t store UserDefaults by implementing a new UserDefaults hook. Fix #633.\r\n9. Fixed a crash in some apps due to symbol name conflicts with system symbols on iOS 26, by preloading affected libraries. Fix #667.\r\n10. We adopted a new method to mitigate an issue where some apps were being killed in the background with code 0xdead10cc.\r\n\r\n# Removed Features\r\n1. **Store patching**: This has been removed. Please use the \"Import Certificate from SideStore/AltStore\" button instead.\r\n2. **Fix black screen**: This is no longer needed, as the underlying issue has been resolved.\r\n3. **Retrieve data from LiveProcess**: This feature has been removed since we can now accurately detect whether LiveProcess is running.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\nThanks @CelloSerenity @a1exsDev @bachig26 for fixing typo/building script/repo files.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to the following contributors for continuing to update translations:\r\n- **Traditional Chinese** \u2014 Jack Black  \r\n- **Italian** \u2014 @Checkm8ra1n  \r\n- **Turkish** \u2014 @sekertr  \r\n- **Vietnamese** \u2014 @khanhduytran0  \r\n- **Portuguese** \u2014 @DaniTrox  \r\n- **Arabic** \u2014 dlshad2  \r\n- **French** \u2014 @p-sage  \r\n- **German** \u2014 @BeityBytes  \r\n- **Japanese** \u2014 @naolad  \r\n- **Swedish** \u2014 @se2crid",

This update brings powerful new features like multitasking and better ADP certificate support, along with several bug fixes, improvements, and new language translations.\r\n\r\n# Multitasking\r\nOne of LiveContainer\u2019s main limitations has been the inability to open more than one app at a time. Our new multitasking feature addresses that.\r\n\r\nYou can now launch multiple apps simultaneously in in-app virtual windows. These windows can be resized, scaled, and even displayed using the native Picture-in-Picture (PiP) feature. On iPads, apps can run in native window mode, displaying each app in a separate system window.\r\n\r\nAnd if you wish, you can choose to run apps in multitasking mode by default in settings.\r\n\r\nTo use multitasking:\r\n1. Convert the app you want to multitask into a **shared app**.\r\n2. Hold its banner and tap **\"Multitask\"**.\r\n\r\n>[!Note]\r\n>1. To use multitasking, ensure you select **\"Keep Extension\"** when installing via SideStore/AltStore.  \r\n>2. Most common apps are compatible, but some may have issues.  \r\n>3. If you want to enable JIT for multitasked apps, you\u2019ll need a JIT enabler that supports attaching by PID \u2014 coming soon in StikDebug.\r\n\r\n# ADP Certificate Support\r\nLiveContainer now officially supports ADP development certificates. Thanks to PR #537 by @SoY0ung, LiveContainer uses the app group included in your `.mobileprovision` file, rather than hard-coded SideStore/AltStore app groups. This unlocks multitasking and other features.\r\n\r\n>[!Note]\r\n>1. Only **development certificates** are supported.  \r\n>2. To use multitasking, your `.mobileprovision` must contain at least one app group. \r\n>3. To enable keychain separation, LiveContainer must be signed with all 128 required keychain access groups.  \r\n>4. We recommend changing LiveContainer's bundle ID to match the `application-identifier` in your `.mobileprovision`.\r\n\r\n# iOS 26 Liquid Glass Support\r\nAlthough LiveContainer is currently built with iOS 18.2 SDK, we include an option to enable Liquid Glass for LiveContainer's UI if you have upgraded to iOS 26. You can find this option in iOS Settings-> Apps -> LiveContainer -> enable Liquid Glass.\r\n\r\n# Improvements\r\n- Optimized app launching process for faster startup:\r\n  - No longer moves shared app data to a private folder.\r\n  - Uses a new method to override the main executable path, avoiding SIGSEGV signal handlers.\r\n  - Removed app lock and use container lock only.\r\n- Added `.tipa` support (#467). Note: this allows installing `.tipa` files, but does not mean the app will run properly without correct entitlements.\r\n- You can now search for apps in the app list.\r\n- Renamed StikJIT (Standalone) to StikDebug.\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed #200 by directly setting `dyld.config.process.mainExecutablePath` to app's real main executable path, ensuring `_NSGetExecutablePath` returns the correct value.\r\n- Fixed #326 by correcting an error in `Info.plist`. Note: HealthKit entitlements are still required to access health data.\r\n- Alleviate #423 by avoiding dyld library validation bypass on signed apps, which otherwise prevents apps that requires JIT from executing JIT pages on A15+\r\n- Fixed #478 by moving the JIT enabling window to `LCAppListView`.\r\n- Fixed #476 by updating ZSign.\r\n- Fixed #497 by resolving an issue in dyld library validation bypass.\r\n- Fixed iOS 16.2 (#495) and iOS 18.4+ on iPad 7 (#531).\r\n- Fixed #518 by sending KVO notifications when UsedDefaults is changed.\r\n- Fixed #582 by invalidating duplicate library load commands.\r\n\r\n# Deprecated Features\r\n## SideStore/AltStore Patching\r\nWith SideStore 0.6.2-20250420.25 and AltStore 2.2.1 both supporting certificate export, patching these stores is no longer necessary. This feature is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.\r\n\r\n# Translations\r\nThanks to our community translators, LiveContainer now supports:\r\n\r\n- **Traditional Chinese** \u2014 Jack Black  \r\n- **Italian** \u2014 @Checkm8ra1n  \r\n- **Turkish** \u2014 @sekertr  \r\n- **Vietnamese** \u2014 @khanhduytran0  \r\n- **Portuguese** \u2014 @DaniTrox  \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to the following contributors for continuing to update translations:\r\n- **Arabic** \u2014 dlshad2  \r\n- **French** \u2014 @p-sage  \r\n- **German** \u2014 @BeityBytes  \r\n- **Japanese** \u2014 @naolad  \r\n- **Swedish** \u2014 @se2crid\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\nShout out to @khanhduytran0 for doing a lot of research under the hood which made the multitasking feature possible! \r\nGreat thanks to @neoarz for providing us certificates so we can test support for ADP certificate!",

Fortunately we have developed the \"Spoof SDK Version\" feature, forcing system libraries to operate in the SDK version the app is built with. You can enable \"Spoof SDK Version\".\r\n\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n## 1. New Re-Sign Strategy\r\nInstead of keeping track of expiration date, LiveContainer now directly ask iOS to determine whether the code signature is valid, which significantly decreases app re-sign rate. For now your apps will be re-signed only if their code signature is invalid, which probably happens when your certificate is expired (usually takes a year), or is revoked (when you reinstall SideStore/AltStore).\r\n\r\n## 2. Support for StikJIT(StikDebug), SideStore JIT\r\n [StikJIT(StikDebug)](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikJIT) is the newest on-device JIT enabler powered by [idevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice). You can now install it both as a standalone app or install it inside LiveContainer. See #265 item 5.8 for more information.\r\n\r\nSideStore has recently switched its backend to idevice and added on-device JIT support. For now its JIT URL Scheme has not been implemented so you have to manually enable JIT for LiveContainer.\r\n\r\n## 3. Spoof SDK version\r\nSpoofing SDK version forces system libraries to operate in the SDK version the app is built with. This fix works surprisingly well so we decided to enable it by default for newly installed apps. This fixes some old apps crashing because of the new SDK. We also removed the \"Bypass AssertBarrierOnQueue\" fix since the root cause is SDK version.\r\n\r\nFix #421 #422\r\n\r\n## 4. Support Import Certificate From SideStore\r\nWith [this SideStore pr](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/pull/959), we can now directly retrieve certificate from SideStore (0.6.2-20250420.25+) without the patch, thus simplifying the process of enabling JIT-Less mode.\r\n\r\n## 5. Game Mode Support\r\nWith the SDK version upgrade, LiveContainer now supports game mode. If you don't need it, you can turn it off in the control center. \r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n1. Fix a regression caused by NSBundle path fix. Fix #409\r\n2. Keep app's plugin folder in case some apps need files inside. Fix hugeBlack/LiveContainer#43\r\n3. Add TPRO rw in overwrite exec path in case the executable path is TPRO protected. Fix #327\r\n4. Replace all `withCheckedContinuation` with `withUnsafeContinuation` to solve crash on iOS 18.0 beta. Fix #435\r\n5. Add file permission to solve some sign issues. Fix #448\r\n\r\n# Removed Features\r\nThe following features are removed because it's not useful in current version or constantly causing issues.\r\n1. AltSign: We drop AltSign support because it's constantly causing issues and it's relatively old.\r\n2. Bypass AssertBarrierOnQueue: It is replaced by \"Spoof SDK version\"\r\n3. Sign Only on Signature Expires: It's now useless as we directly determine if an app's code signature is valid by asking the system.\r\n\r\n# Translation\r\nLiveContainer is now translated into Arabic, Simplified Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese and Swedish\r\n- Arabic: translated by dlshad2\r\n- French: translated by @p-sage\r\n- German: translated by @BeityBytes\r\n- Japanese: translated by @naolad\r\n- Portuguese: translated by damn_the_daniel\r\n- Swedish: translated by @se2crid\r\n\r\n# Credit\r\nShout out to @khanhduytran0 for doing a lot of research under the hood!\r\n\r\n# Other\r\nLiveContainer is now migrated from a Theos project to a Xcode project, which simplifies the development and significantly decreased Github Actions build time (2 minutes now and around 10 minutes previously)",

                    "localizedDescription": "This update includes several compatibility and bug fixes, as well as new features such as JITStreamer-EB support and the ability to install from URLs and share sheets. Additionally, we have changed some confusing text.\r\n\r\n>[!Note]\r\nDue to a change of LiveContainer's entitlement and a bug with SideStore/AltStore, SideStore 0.6.0+ / AltStore 2.0+ is **required** to install LiveContainer 3.3.0\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n## Install from URL / Share Sheet\r\nYou can now install apps directly from a URL by using the plus button on the \"My Apps\" page or by using an install URL like `livecontainer://install?url=xxxxxxx`. Additionally, you can share an IPA file directly from other apps via the share sheet. (Please note that iOS may hide LiveContainer in the \"More\" section\u2014simply tap \"More\" and scroll down to find it.)\r\n## Share File to Guest Apps\r\nFiles can now be shared to guest apps when they are running through the share sheet.\r\n\r\nImplement #320\r\n\r\n## JITStreamer-EB Support\r\n[JITStreamer-EB](https://jkcoxson.com/jitstreamer) is now available in LiveContainer. To use it:\r\n- Set it up first in JITStreamer-EB's website\r\n- Go to LiveContainer settings->JIT Enabler->Select JITStreamer-EB. You can leave the \"Address\" blank if you are using official server and it's default to `http://[fd00::]:9172`.\r\n- Long press the app that needs JIT->Settings->enable Launch with JIT->Tap Run, LiveContainer will contact the server and enable JIT for that app.\r\n\r\n>[!Note]\r\nJIT is broken in iOS 18.4 Beta 1, please avoid this version.\r\n\r\n## \"Entitlement File\" Section in JITLess Diagnose\r\nThe \"Entitlement File\" section is now available in the JITLess Diagnose page, making it easier and more accurate to diagnose issues with your JITLess setup.\r\n\r\n## Personal Certificate Support (Untestsed)\r\nLiveContainer can now be used without SideStore/AltStore if you import the certificate used to sign it. Please note that for LiveContainer to work correctly, some changes must be made to the bundle and entitlement:\r\n- The bundle ID must match the one in the .mobileprovision file without a prefix.\r\n- LiveContainer must be signed with the get-task-allow=true entitlement, meaning Enterprise certificates will not work.\r\n- To use the keychain separation feature, LiveContainer must be signed with the correct entitlement. Please refer to entitlements.xml for the required keychain access groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can check these criteria in Settings->JITLess Diagnose->Entitlement File. All items except com.apple.security.application-groups should be green.\r\n\r\nImplement #54 #64 #231\r\n\r\n## Up to 128 Containers Per App\r\nWith the release of SideStore 0.6.0, which fixes the entitlement issue with Keychain Access Groups, you can now create up to 128 containers for each app. Each container created in version 3.3.0 will be assigned a random Keychain Access Group to prevent crashes caused by Keychain Access Group collisions.\r\n\r\n## Hide LiveContainer\r\nTo bypass some app's injection detection, 3 following options are added to app-specific settings.\r\n- Hide LiveContainer from Dyld Api\r\n- Don't Inject TweakLoader\r\n- Don't Load TweakLoader\r\n\r\nFor most apps, enabling the first two options should be sufficient to bypass injection detection. However, please note that if TweakLoader is not loaded, some features (like app fast switching) may not be available.\r\n\r\nFix #146 #338\r\n\r\n## Archive Option when Installing 2nd LiveContainer\r\nYou can now archive the second LiveContainer instead of installing it directly, allowing you to customize it as needed.\r\n\r\n## URL to Launch to LiveContainer's UI\r\nYou can now use `livecontainer://livecontainer-launch?bundle-name=ui`to launch to LiveContainer's UI\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix #314: Frameworks in the tweaks folder are now signed and injected correctly.\r\n- Fix #318: Resolved an issue in fishhook that caused crashes when handling invalid `symtab_index`.\r\n- Fix #332: Fixed a dyld issue where the wrong image was being used when dyld functions were hooked.\r\n- Fix #329: Insert `LC_ID_DYLIB` load command to resolve segment-related issues.\r\n- Fix #358 #374: Dopamine's dyld patch is taken into account when bypassing dyld library validation.\r\n- Fix #381: LiveContainer can correctly close itself when it is hidden.\r\n- Fix #384: All settings are correctly copied when replacing app.\r\n- Fixed UI issues when the \"Button Shape\" accessibility setting was enabled.\r\n- Improved some previously confusing or misleading text.",

Please refer to the \"Black Screen Fix\" section below for more details.\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n## Black Screen Fix\r\nThe Black Screen Fix is no longer applied automatically to prevent loading `UIKit.framework` before the app\u2019s main executable is opened, which could cause symbol binding issues. You can enable it in Long press app -> Settings -> enable Fix Black Screen\r\n\r\n## App Group Isolation\r\nYou can now isolate app groups for different containers, allowing multiple accounts (e.g., in SideStore) to be signed in within separate containers. You can find files inside app group in container folder -> LCAppGroup\r\n\r\nYou can enable this feature by: Long press app -> Settings -> (Container name) -> enable Isolate App Group\r\nFix #279\r\n\r\n## Open URL Automatically\r\nYou can now automatically open an URL in current app without being prompted.\r\nImplement #285 \r\n\r\n## Ignore Error During dlopen\r\nThis fixes errors like `dlsym(xxxx, xxxx)` caused by app's initializers calling dlsym with a non-existing symbol\r\n\r\nFix issues like #124\r\n\r\n## Better App Signature Check\r\nThe team ID used in app signing is now considered when determining if an app needs re-signing. This allows apps to be re-signed if they are transferred between LiveContainers installed by different Apple IDs.\r\n\r\n## JIT-Less Mode Diagnose Page & LiveContainer Help\r\nA new JIT-Less Mode Diagnose Page helps new users quickly identify configuration issues. Problematic items are highlighted in red for easy troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nYou can see this page in Settings -> JIT-Less Mode Diagnose.\r\nYou can see LiveContainer help in Apps -> ? Button\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes & Compatibility\r\n## Separate App-Specific Settings from Info.plist\r\nApp-Specific Settings is now saved in a different file to prevent app from crashing due to reading it.\r\n\r\nFix #277\r\n\r\n## Hook dlsym(RTLD_MAIN_ONLY,xxx)\r\nRedirect this call to the app's main executable instead of LiveContainer's to prevent issues.\r\n\r\nFix #124 #130 #140 #221 #225\r\n\r\n## Don't Link against UIKit.framework\r\n*This solution is provided by khanhduytran0*\r\n`UIKit.framework` is now not linked by LiveContainer's main executable to prevent symbol binding issues. However this will prevent the black screen fix to be automatically applied.\r\n\r\nFix #277 #272 #200 #139\r\n\r\n## App Hiding Without Device Password\r\nApp hiding now works even if the device doesn\u2019t have a password set.\r\n\r\nFix #281\r\n\r\n## (Regression) Fix 2 Bugs in NSUserDefaultsHook in 3.1.0\r\nFix #276 #291\r\n\r\n## Fix long press actions of last guest app remain\r\nFix #235\r\n\r\n## Fix Apps Unable to Open Their Own URL Schemes\r\nFix #44\r\n\r\n## Resolve Crash Loop with Blank `Info.plist`\r\nHandles cases where `Info.plist` is blank due to app corruption, which previously crashes LiveContainerSwiftUI.\r\nFix #293\r\n\r\n## Fix CallKit Unable to Initialize \r\nFix #258\r\n\r\n## Fix Crash when Patching Store\r\nThe cause of this issue is that LiveContainer cannot access App Group due to incorrect setup.",

You can switch signer in Settings and app-specific settings for one specific app.\r\n\r\n## Re-Sign Only on Expiration\r\nLiveContainer now keeps track of the date of expiration of each app's code signature and only signs when its signature is expired. So re-signing happens less frequent than before.\r\n\r\n## Automatic Tweak Re-Sign\r\nLiveContainer now keeps track of the tweaks you added and re-signs it if it is changed or its code signature expires, which makes tweak development with LiveContainer more convenient.\r\n\r\nImplement #175.\r\n\r\n## Multiple Container Support\r\nYou can now create up to 3 containers for each app, so you can log in multiple accounts in different containers(data folders).\r\n\r\nKeychains are now semi-separated between app containers. Note that keychains will be removed if you delete a container in LiveContainer.\r\n\r\nkeychains created in older version will remain untouched so you can continue using your apps like before. To use this feature, clean up your keychain in LiveContainer settings.\r\n\r\nThis feature, along with the following fix of NSUserDefault leak impelements #218 #176.\r\n\r\n## Language Selection for Each App\r\nYou can now choose an language for an app in app-specific settings.\r\n\r\nImplement #171\r\n\r\n## App Preferences\r\nYou can now modify app preferences in LiveContainer like in iOS Settings.

App and their data, Keychains and most preferences can be shared between these two. If user open an app via URL Scheme or from My Apps screen, the LiveContainer that last ran that app will be switched to.\r\n\r\n### Better Open in App Support (#153)\r\nIt turns out that some apps don't rely on URL Schemes and use Universal Links instead. In this update, the web page's `apple-app-site-association` will be checked and LiveContainer will launch app based on it.\r\n\r\n### Localization (#153)\r\nLocalization is now supported. You can add a language in LiveContainerSwiftUI project and add your translation in `Localizable.xcstrings`, then submit your translation as PR. We may consider adding something like a Crowdin page if it\u2019s large enough (?)\r\n\r\n### Dedicated AltStore/SideStore source (#156)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n### iOS file picker issue (#153): #68, #123, #142\r\n\r\n### Duplicated Flutter-based app bundle name (#153): #112\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\nI'd like to thank @hugeBlack a lot for covering most of this update (#153), and thank @Staubgeborener for #156",

Apparently using the private Preference framework causing changes to be saved to the wrong preference file.\r\n- Some apps may get stuck on a black screen caused by an unknown deadlock. This is worked around by pre-initializing `UIScreen`.\r\n- Some apps may fail to create temporary files. This is fixed by redirecting guest app\u2019s temporary directory to that of LiveContainer using symlink instead of creating its own. (thanks @hugeBlack for hinting me the issue)",

SideStore resigns apps with your personal development certificate, and then uses a [specially designed VPN](https://github.com/jkcoxson/em_proxy) in order to trick iOS into installing them. SideStore will periodically \"refresh\" your apps in the background, to keep their normal 7-day development period from expiring.\n\nSideStore's goal is to provide an untethered sideloading experience. It's a community driven fork of [AltStore](https://github.com/rileytestut/AltStore), and has already implemented some of the community's most-requested features.\n\nRequirements\n- Xcode 15\n- iOS 15+\n- Rustup (`brew install rustup`)\n\nWhy iOS 15? Targeting such a recent version of iOS allows us to accelerate development, especially since not many developers have older devices to test on. This is corrobated by the fact that SwiftUI support is much better, allowing us to transistion to a more modern UI codebase.\n\nSideStore\nSideStore is a just regular, sandboxed iOS application. The AltStore app target contains the vast majority of SideStore's functionality, including all the logic for downloading and updating apps through SideStore. SideStore makes heavy use of standard iOS frameworks and technologies most iOS developers are familiar with.",

            "localizedDescription": "Nugget (mobile)\nUnlock your device's full potential! Should work on all versions iOS 16.0 - 18.2 developer beta 2 (public beta 1).\n\nThis will not work on iOS 18.2 beta 2 or newer. Please do not make issues about this, it will not be fixed. You will have to use the [pc version of Nugget](https://github.com/leminlimez/Nugget) unless a fix comes in the future.\n\nA `.mobiledevicepairing` file and wireguard are required in order to use this. Read the [sections](#getting-your-mobiledevicepairing-file) below to see how to get those.\n\nIf you are having issues with minimuxer, see the [Solving Minimuxer Issues](#solving-minimuxer-issues) thread.\n\nThis uses the sparserestore exploit to write to files outside of the intended restore location, like mobilegestalt.\n\nNote: I am not responsible if your device bootloops, use this software with caution. Please back up your data before using!\n\n## Getting Your mobiledevicepairing File\nTo get the pairing file, use the following steps:\n1. Download `jitterbugpair` for your system from here: <https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/latest>\n    - **Note:** On mac or linux, you may have to run the terminal command `chmod +x ./jitterbugpair` in the same directory.\n2. Run the program by either double clicking it or using terminal/powershell\n3. Share the `.mobiledevicepairing` file to your iOS device\n4. Open the app and select the pairing file\n\nYou should only have to do this once unless you lose the file and delete the app's data.\n\n## Setting Up WireGuard\n1. Download [WireGuard](<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209>) on the iOS App Store.\n2. Download [SideStore's config file](https://github.com/sidestore/sidestore/releases/download/0.1.1/sidestore.conf) on your iOS device\n3. Share the config file to WireGuard using the share menu\n4. Enable it and run Nugget\n\n## Solving Minimuxer Issues\nIf you have used Cowabunga Lite before, you may experience issues with minimuxer. This is due to how it skipped the setup process.\nThese steps should solve the problem, however it is not an end-all be-all solution.\n1. Download [Nugget Python](https://github.com/leminlimez/Nugget) and follow the steps in the readme to install python and the requirements\n2. Connect your device and (in terminal) type `python3 fix-minimuxer.py` (or `python fix-minimuxer.py` if it doesn't work)\n\nYour device should reboot. After it reboots, try Nugget mobile now. If it still doesn't work, follow the steps below:\n\n3. After your device reboots, go to `[Settings] -> General -> Transfer or Reset iPhone`\n4. Tap `Reset` and then `Reset Location & Privacy`\n5. Nugget mobile should work now. If it doesn't, try getting a new pairing file.\n\nIf the steps above don't work for you, try using `Cowabunga Lite` and clicking the `Deep Clean` button, then try the steps again.\nIf not even that works, the only solution I know is to wipe the device (not ideal). I would recommend using [Nugget Python](https://github.com/leminlimez/Nugget) instead in this case.\n\n## Credits\n- [JJTech](https://github.com/JJTech0130) for Sparserestore/[TrollRestore](https://github.com/JJTech0130/TrollRestore)\n- khanhduytran for [Sparsebox](https://github.com/khanhduytran0/SparseBox)\n- [pymobiledevice3](https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3)\n- [disfordottie](https://x.com/disfordottie) for some global flag features\n- f1shy-dev for the old [AI Enabler](https://gist.github.com/f1shy-dev/23b4a78dc283edd30ae2b2e6429129b5#file-eligibility-plist)\n- [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/) for em_proxy and minimuxer\n- [libimobiledevice](https://libimobiledevice.org) for the restore library\n",

Ferrite relies on this type of endpoint for rich display of instantly available magnets.\r\n\r\nThe workaround: A user's magnet library now serves as the instant availability cache. There is now a manual `Download to Debrid` button on the context menu for each search result and bookmark so a user can manually queue a magnet for downloading. If the magnet is instantly available, it'll show the file contents as before and add the magnet to the user's instant availability cache (making the debrid badge green!).\r\n\r\nHere's a picture showing where this new button is located:\r\n![Simulator Screenshot - iPhone 16 Pro - 2024-11-27 at 23 24 38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85735a40-2a4b-4aea-bbfa-b0ba0049b3ec)\r\n\r\nAt this time, I do not recommend using RealDebrid or AllDebrid. However, the above workaround makes these services useable. This UI will improve with upcoming releases.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n- Add a context menu button to manually cache a search result/bookmark to debrid\r\n- Adapt to RealDebrid and AllDebrid's API changes\r\n- Fix settings menu showing if a debrid is enabled or disabled\r\n",

            "subtitle": "A TrollStore installer for iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1",
            "localizedDescription": "Overview\nTrollInstallerX is a universal TrollStore installer. It focuses on being extremely reliable and easy to use. It is also very fast, being able to install TrollStore and/or its persistence helper in a matter of seconds on the latest devices.\n\nTrollInstallerX supports all devices running iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1, both arm64 and arm64e. It makes use of one of two different methods to install TrollStore, depending on what device and iOS you have. These methods are:\n\n* **Direct installation**: using the [kfd](https://github.com/felix-pb/kfd) kernel exploit, along with the [dmaFail](https://github.com/opa334/Dopamine/blob/2.x/Application/Dopamine/Exploits/dmaFail/dmaFail.c) PPL bypass on iOS 15.2+ arm64e devices, TrollInstallerX can install both TrollStore and its persistence helper directly onto the device without having to leave the installer.\n  * Supports iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1 (arm64) and iOS 14.0 - 16.5.1 (arm64e).\n    * **Note**: A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1 do not support this method.\n    * **Note**: A8 devices are only supported on iOS 14.0 - 15.1 for the time being.\n\n* **Indirect installation**: Using the [kfd](https://github.com/felix-pb/kfd) kernel exploit, TrollInstallerX can replace a system application of your choice with the TrollStore persistence helper. This method only exists due to both the lack of a PPL bypass on iOS 16.6 and above, as well as the fact that dmaFail is non-functional on A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1.\n  * Supports iOS 16.5.1 - 16.6.1 (arm64e).\n    * **Note**: This method is the only method that supports A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1.\n\nBoth methods allow you to install a persistence helper into a removable system app. The reason that this is needed is due to the way that the CoreTrust bug (used by TrollStore) works - in certain circumstances, TrollStore and other apps installed by it will be reset to User registration, instead of System. You cannot open any of these apps until you have used the persistence helper to set them back to System registration.\n\n## Usage\nTrollInstallerX is extremely easy to use. Simply download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/alfiecg24/TrollInstallerX/releases) page, and sideload it using your preferred method. Once installed, open the app and press the \"Install\" button. From there, TrollStore and/or its persistence helper will be installed onto your device.\n\nTrollInstallerX will automatically choose the best exploit for your device. However, in some cases, you may want to choose a specific exploit. To do this, simply open the settings view and select the exploit that you want to use. Once you have selected it, press the \"Install TrollStore\" button and TrollInstallerX will use the exploit you have chosen.\n\n**Note**: iOS 16.2 - 16.6.1 and iOS 15.7.2 - 15.8.2 require an internet connection in order for TrollInstallerX to download the kernelcache and patchfind it.\n\n## FAQ\n> Why am I stuck at \"Exploiting kernel\"?\n\nThis is a common issue with the kfd exploit. Simply reboot your device and try again.\n\n> Why can I not open/see TrollStore after a successful installation?\n\nDuring installation, you will have installed a persistence helper. Open your persistence helper and press \"refresh app registrations\" to fix TrollStore not being able to be opened.\n\n> Why did the app I selected for the persistence helper not become the persistence helper?\n\nIf you selected an app for the persistence helper and it did not change, it is likely that you already have a persistence helper installed. Open TrollStore and go to settings to see which app is set to the persistence helper.\n\n> Why am I getting an error about being unable to patchfind or being unable to download kernel?\n\nEither:\n- You're on a non-MacDirtyCow supported version, and are not connected to the internet, or;\n- You're using a Yellow iPhone 14 or Yellow iPhone 14 Plus on iOS 16.3 (20D50), in which case you should install `TrollInstallerX-20D50.ipa` from [here](https://github.com/alfiecg24/TrollInstallerX/releases/latest).\n\nAdditionally, if a file exists at `/TrollInstallerX.app/kernelcache`, TrollInstallerX will use that file instead of downloading the kernelcache. This can be useful if you have a slow or unreliable internet connection, or happen to have a device and version combination that has no public kernelcache available.\n\n> Why does TrollInstallerX say \"failed to install persistence helper\" using the indirect method?\n\nThe indirect method is not perfect, and sometimes it will fail to install the persistence helper. If this happens, simply shut down your device, turn it back on, and try again. If you repeatedly have issues with the same app, try using a different app.\n\n## Building\nTrollInstallerX is a regular Xcode project, but the project also contains a build script. To build it and produce an IPA, simply run the `build.sh` script in the root of the project. This will build the project and produce an IPA in the root of the project.\n\n## Credits\nTrollInstallerX wouldn't have been possible without the work of the following people:\n* [opa334](https://x.com/opa334dev) for [Dopamine](https://github.com/opa334/Dopamine), the dmaFail exploit and the kernel patchfinder\n* [felix-pb](https://github.com/felix-pb) for the kfd exploits\n* [Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/operation-triangulation-the-last-hardware-mystery/111669/) for Operation Triangulation\n* [kok3shidoll](https://github.com/kok3shidoll) for lots of work on arm64 support for Dopamine\n* [wh1te4ever](https://github.com/wh1te4ever) for [kfund](https://github.com/wh1te4ever/kfund)\n* [Zhuowei](https://github.com/zhuowei) for the tccd unsandboxing method\n* [xina520](https://x.com/xina520) for the kernel read/write-only privilege escalation method\n* [dhinakg](https://github.com/dhinakg) for the memory hogger, the MacDirtyCow kernelcache grabber method, [libpartial](https://github.com/dhinakg/partial) and help with [libgrabkernel2](https://github.com/alfiecg24/libgrabkernel2)\n* [staturnz](https://github.com/staturnzz) for work on the kernel patchfinder\n* [aaronp613](https://x.com/aaronp613) for the TrollInstallerX icon\n* [DTCalabro](https://github.com/DTCalabro) and [JJTech](https://github.com/JJTech0130) for improvements to the logging system\n* [MasterMike88](https://x.com/MasterMike88) for helping test and debug during development\n",

                    "localizedDescription": "# TrollInstallerX v1.0.0\r\n\r\nTrollInstallerX is a reliable, fast and simple TrollStore installer. It has several features that set it apart from the other installers out there, detailed below. It supports iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1 on all devices (apart from a slight exception for A8 devices, which is only temporary). Certain versions have a slightly different installation method, which you can read about in the [README](https://github.com/alfiecg24/TrollInstallerX).\r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n* **Direct installation of TrollStore** - On supported versions, TrollInstallerX can install TrollStore directly to your home screen, as if you were to install it via the persistence helper.\r\n\r\n* **Persistence helper installation** - TrollInstallerX will properly install a persistence helper into a removable system app of your choice - this means one that doesn't rely on temperamental file overwrites, but rather one that TrollStore will recognise as a legitimate persistence helper. This method works on all versions supported by TrollInstallerX.\r\n\r\n* **Unprecedented reliability** - Thanks to the extremely reliable [XPF patchfinder](https://github.com/opa334/XPF) (used in Dopamine), TrollInstallerX has a very high success rate with exploitation. When possible, it will either use the on-disk kernelcache, or download a copy of it to patchfind. This is detailed below.\r\n\r\n* **libgrabkernel2** - The new [libgrabkernel2](https://github.com/alfiecg24/libgrabkernel2) library allows for downloading almost any kernelcache available for the devices supported by TrollInstallerX. \r\n\r\n* **MacDirtyCow kernelcache grabber** - On versions supported by MacDirtyCow, MacDirtyCow is used to unsandbox and TrollInstallerX simply uses the on-disk kernelcache instead.\r\n\r\n* **iOS 14 support** - iOS 14 is completely supported with TrollInstallerX. For arm64 devices on iOS 14, this is one of the few installers that supports them. However, TrollHelperOTA is still the recommended installation method for arm64e devices on iOS 14.\r\n\r\nInformation on how to use TrollInstallerX, as well as FAQs and credits, can be found in the README of this repository.",

Then, it reallocates\ncertain kernel objects inside those physical pages and manipulates them directly from user space\nthrough the dangling PTEs in order to achieve a KRKW primitive, short for \"kernel read/write\".

For the frames, each image must be named \"trollformation\" with a number afterwards (ie. trollformation1.png, trollformation2.png, trollformation3.png...). You can use up to 120 frames, though I am not sure of the exact size limit, which is probably much less.\n**If your animation is not exactly 40 frames or you want to customize the display length of each frame, you need to define the animations.** This is very simple to do:\n1. Create a json file named `animations.json`\n2. Define the values. Format: `\"Frame Number\": Time Interval`\nExample:\n`\nExplanation:\nYou do not need to state the length of each frame. The only time that absolutely needs to be defined is the first frame. If you did not set a time for the frame, Cowabunga will use the time from the last frame.\nThe `Time Interval` is how long the frame stays on the screen for.\n**Important:** The frame number must be a string (meaning in quotes) because of how json decoding works.\n",

Languages include: French, Russian, Polish, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Turkish, Hebrew, and Korean. More will come in the future! Some translations may be incomplete.\r\n\r\n**About App Themes**\r\nWebClips are a thing of the past! You can now customize both regular app icons and system icons while keeping notification badges! Unfortunately, compression is needed in order to keep the file sizes below the original (this is a macdirtycow limitation). This means that for some simpler icons, especially for YouTube and Snapchat, they will look very blurry or pixelated. If this happens, just use shortcuts instead for the time being.\r\n\r\n**About Custom Operations**\r\nCustom operations allow you to change files from a custom file path, with the ability to run in the background so they stay applied! You can swap plist values, replace files, or corrupt/disable files. It works best with a file manager so that you can find file paths to change. It will also tell you if replacing the file normally works, otherwise it will revert back to MacDirtyCow, where you will need to have a file less than or equal to the original size. This is intended for more advanced users. BE CAREFUL, I am not responsible for bootloops or any damage to your device. More features will come to this in the future.\r\n\r\n**About Custom Locks**\r\nAny TrollLock theme should work with Cowabunga.

            "localizedDescription": "Introduction\nPojavLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android, iOS, and iPadOS, based off of zhuowei's [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk) project.\n* Supports most versions of Minecraft: Java Edition, from the very first beta to the newest snapshots.\n* Supports Forge, Fabric, OptiFine, and Quilt for you to customize the experience with supported mods.\n* Includes customizable on-screen controls, keyboard and mouse support, and game controller support.\n* Optimized for jailbroken and TrollStore devices to enable better capabilities.\n* Microsoft account and demo mode support for logging into Minecraft.\n* ...and much more!\n\nThis repository contains the code for our iOS and iPadOS port of PojavLauncher. Looking for [Android?](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher)\n\n## Getting started with PojavLauncher\nThe [PojavLauncher Website](https://pojavlauncherteam.github.io/INSTALL.html#ios) has extensive documentation on how to install, set up, and play! For those who wish to install quickly, here's the basics:\n\n### Requirements\nAt the minimum, you'll need one of the following devices on **iOS 14.0** and later:\n- iPhone 6s and later\n- iPad (5th generation) and later\n- iPad Air (2nd generation) and later\n- iPad mini (4th generation) and later\n- iPad Pro (all models)\n- iPod touch (7th generation)\n\nHowever, we recommend one of the following devices on **iOS 14.0** and later:\n- iPhone XS and later, excluding iPhone XR and iPhone SE (2nd generation)\n- iPad (10th generation) and later\n- iPad Air (4th generation) and later\n- iPad mini (6th generation) and later\n- iPad Pro (all models, except for 9.7-inch)\n\nRecommended devices provide a smoother and more enjoyable gameplay experience compared to other supported devices.\n- tvOS support is in development.\n- iOS 17.x and iOS 18.x is supported. However, a computer is required. These methods will ultilized usage of pymobiledevice3. Python 3.11.(x) must be properly set up on your computer. For more information, please check out the official Wiki: https://pojavlauncherteam.github.io/JIT.html#what-are-the-methods-to-enable-jit\n\n### Setting up to sideload\nPojavLauncher can be sideloaded in many ways. Our recommended solution is to install [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore) if your iOS version supports it. Installing with TrollStore allows you to permenantly sign the application, automatically enable JIT, and increase memory limits.\n\nFor iOS/iPadOS 17.0: Unfortunately,the above process will not work. It is required that you must use [TrollRestore](https://github.com/JJTech0130/TrollRestore). Any versions above iOS/iPadOS 17.0 will NOT be supported (as of December 23, 2024).\n\nIf you cannot, [AltStore](https://altstore.io) and [SideStore](https://sidestore.io) are your next best options.\n- Signing services that do not use your UDID (and use distribution certificates) are not supported, as PojavLauncher requires capabilities they do not allow. However, if you do managed to gain access to a Development certificate, due to it having the necessary entitlement (being com.apple.security.get-task-allow) to attach a debugger to the running process (enabling JIT), you may use a Development certificate.\n  \n- Only install sideloading software and PojavLauncher from trusted sources. We are not responsible for any harm caused by using unofficial software.\n- Jailbreaks also benefit from permenant signing, autoJIT, and increased memory limits, however we do not recommend them for regular use.\n\n### Installing PojavLauncher\n#### Release build (TrollStore)\n1. Download an IPA of PojavLauncher in [Releases](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/releases).\n2. Open the package in TrollStore using the share menu.",

Beautifully redesigned.\r\nWorking to align the designs of iOS and Android, we've reimagined the user interface into an easy-to-use split view. **Tabs on the left, content on the right**. A **brand-new News screen** replaces the FAQ for always up-to-date information from the team. A **redesigned Settings screen** allows you to fine tune PojavLauncher - even in game. An **intuitive Log Output** screen can be displayed during runtime - allowing you to share line-by-line or all in, automatically presenting in the event of a crash.\r\n\r\n### Bring your own controls.\r\nWe began PojavLauncher by introducing touch controls. We improved on this by making them customizable in so many ways. And now - we've heightened them again, by **adding support for keyboard, mouse, and even controllers.** If it works with iOS, it will most likely work with PojavLauncher too.\r\n\r\n### New account types - so everyone can enjoy.\r\nDon't own Minecraft but want to enjoy? We've got you covered - **demo mode** comes to PojavLauncher. Sign in with a Microsoft account and try out Minecraft on your device. \r\n\r\n### Preparing for the future.\r\nOver this past year, we've seen a lot of changes with Minecraft. We've adapted PojavLauncher again and again, and continue to adapt with multiple changes, such as **removing Mojang login support.** With PojavLauncher 2.1, we begin a transition to **deprecate support for iOS 12 and 13**, focusing on future technologies.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo our PojavLauncher iOS users,\r\nWe hope you enjoy this release as much as we enjoyed making it. Even though it's a .1, we really did make a lot of changes to make this a more complete launcher; we dramatically increased compatibility with 1.19 support and unjailbroken builds, improved customization with a brand new user interface and support for new input methods, added support for free users to enjoy the game, and have begun a major transition to our future. We appreciate you all for backing us throughout all of these years, and hope to continue providing that Java-Edition-in-your-pocket experience that you have come to know and love. \r\n\r\n\\- Eilionoir\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n_**A full changelog is also available in the News tab of the launcher.**_\r\n\r\n<details hidden>\r\n<summary><strong>Full changelog</strong></summary>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### System support changes\r\n* PojavLauncher now supports unjailbroken devices, with the following caveats:\r\n   * You will need a support app to launch with JIT enabled. JitStreamer integration is done to automate this task.\r\n   * Initial Wi-Fi connection is required to enable JIT. Cellular data isn\u2019t supported, Wi-Fi hotspot might be a workaround.\r\n   * RAM allocation is limited. Attempt to go beyond the limit will result in random crashes while loading world chunks.\r\n* TrollStore can now be used to install on supported devices and iOS versions\r\n   * All caveats above do not apply to TrollStore installations, even unjailbroken.\r\n* Last release to support devices with less than 2GB RAM\r\n* Last release to ship with a .deb package for jailbroken devices\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n* Added Demo mode support\r\n* Automatic Java version and Renderer selection\r\n* Cosmetica custom capes integration\r\n* Complete Controller support\r\n* Keyboard and mouse support deepened\r\n* Many settings that were missing from Android are added\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n* Patch log4shell exploit in client\r\n\r\n### User interface\r\n* Redesigned Launcher UI to match Android\r\n* The current login state will be shown in the title\r\n* Play button is greyed out when launching\r\n* Back button is hidden when launching\r\n* Custom controls UI completed!\r\n* The control button editor is now a movable window\r\n* When game crash occurs, Log Output will be shown for user to determine the problem in place\r\n* Multilingual support: you can contribute your translation through Crowdin\r\n* Support Stage Manager resizing and external displays\r\n* Support AirPlay\r\n* New switch to unlock iPadOS UI, allows iPhone users to unlock certain features that are only available on iPad (floating keyboard for example)\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n* Slight changes to error messages\r\n* Fix Makefile errors in `deploy` and `ipa`\r\n* Fix NullPointerException when launching \u22641.6.4\r\n* Fix NullPointerException when setting inherited fields\r\n* Fix \u201cShare your logs\u201d not working\r\n* Fix Forge, Fabric 1.17+ not launching\r\n* Fix postinst issue on Procursus\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n* Installing with AppSync Unified will result in incorrect directories.\r\n* Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers are only officially supported since iOS 16.0\r\n* Mouse support requires iOS 14.0 or later, keyboards require iOS 13.4 or later\r\n* Old (pre-2.0) custom control .json files no longer work, remove to fix\r\n* This is the last release that will support Apple devices with less than 2GB of RAM.\r\n* This is the last release that will ship with a .deb package for jailbroken users.\r\n* Mojang login has been removed with this release due to the March 10th deadline\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
