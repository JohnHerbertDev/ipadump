You may lose app data, and other damage could occur.\n\n## Features\n- Downgrade most applications available on the App Store (you will need to input the link to the app store app).\n\n## How do I downgrade an application?\n1. The application you want to downgrade will need to be uninstalled. If you want to keep the app data, offload the app first.\n2. Install PancakeStore using your preferred sideloading method.\n3. Log in your Apple ID, and click \"Send 2FA Code.\" If you can, try sending a 2FA code before logging in (there should be this in the settings app, but it was removed in iOS 18?).\n4. In most cases, you should get a popup. Accept the new login, and copy the verification code into the 2FA field. If you don't get that popup, type six random numbers into the 2FA field. I assume this works because you must've logged into MuffinStoreJailed/PancakeStore at a different time. \n5. Click \"log in\" and go to the App Store.\n6. Find the application you're looking for, click the share button, and copy the link.\n7. Go back to PancakeStore and click the clipboard button.\n8. Click \"Downgrade App\" and wait patiently!\n",

This app uses [idevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice) and lockdownd pairing to retrieve installed apps.\n\n### Features\n\n- List, open, and delete \"System\" & \"User\" apps.\n- View entitlements, signing identity, and additional misc info.\n\n## Download\n\nVisit [releases](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Antrag/releases) and get the latest `.ipa`.\n\n## How does it work?\n\n- Establish a heartbeat with a TCP provider (the app will need this for later).\n  - For it to be successful, we need a pairing file from [JitterbugPair](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases) and a [VPN](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stosvpn/id6744003051).\n- When preparing the list, we need to establish another connection but for `installation_proxy` using our heartbeat provider and client handle.\n- Then we can use `installation_proxy_get_apps` using that handle to list applications.\n\nDue to how it works right now we need both a VPN and a lockdownd pairing file, this means you will need a computer for its initial setup.\n\n## Building\n\n#### Minimum requirements\n\n- Xcode 16\n- Swift 5.9\n- iOS 16\n\n1. Clone repository\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/khcrysalis/Antrag\n    ```\n\n2. Compile\n    ```sh\n    cd Antrag\n    gmake\n    ```\n\n3. Updating\n    ```sh\n    git pull\n    ```\n\nUsing the makefile will automatically create an adhoc ipa inside the packages directory, using this to debug or report issues is not recommend. When making a pull request or reporting issues, it's generally advised you've used Xcode to debug your changes properly.\n\n## Sponsors\n\n| Thanks to all my [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/khcrysalis)!! |\n|:-:|\n| <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khcrysalis/github-sponsor-graph/main/graph.png\"> |\n| _**\"samara is cute\" - Vendicated**_ |\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- [Samara](https://github.com/khcrysalis) - The maker\n- [idevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice) - Backend functionality, uses `installation_proxy` to retrieve messages.\n\n## License \n\nThis project is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license.

The app handles the handshake automatically.\r\n * Picture-in-Picture (PiP): Added a PiP toggle to the video player overlay. Watch your streams while using other apps!\r\n * Seek Controls: Added -10s and +10s buttons to the player overlay.\r\n * \"Jump to Live\" Button: The new LIVE indicator is now interactive. If you are behind, tap it to jump instantly to the latest point in the stream.\r\n *  Multiview: Added a multi-view section to watch up to 4 streams at the same time\r\n\r\nImprovements\r\n * Smart Search Fallback: If a specific game isn't found in Sports Center, the app now automatically searches for the broadcasting network (e.g., \"ESPN\") instead of showing zero results.\r\n * Sidebar Organization: Reordered sidebar items for better access: Recently Watched \u2192 Favorites \u2192 Sports Center \u2192 Multi-View \u2192 All Channels.\r\n * Update Logic: Added a \"Don't Ask Again\" option to the update alert to mute notifications for a specific version.\r\n * Login UI: Redesigned the login picker to support two lines of text, preventing cutoff on smaller screens.\r\n * More soccer leagues: Added more soccer leagues in the sports center section (Ligue 1, Serie A, Liga MX, and more)\r\n \r\nBug Fixes\r\n * Fixed Video Freezing: Completely rewrote the buffer logic to prevent the player from getting stuck on the first frame or freezing indefinitely during network stalls.\r\n * Fixed Multi-View Cropping: Streams in multi-view mode now show the full video picture instead of zooming in and cropping the edges.\r\n * Fixed Text Cutoff: Login instructions and titles now auto-shrink to fit any screen size without being cut off.\r\n \r\nHow to Install:\r\nDownload the .ipa file below and install via SideStore, AltStore, or TrollStore.\r\n",

Browse public sources, download IPAs, and install/launch apps directly on your device.</i></p>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n> **\u26a1 Quick Start**: To enable automatic app installation to LiveContainer, select its directory (\"On My iPhone\" > \"LiveContainer\") on your device (see **[Fix File Picker](#fix-file-picker)** if unable). Then, enable **\"Auto .ipa to .app\"** in LBox Settings.\n\n## \ud83d\udce5 Download\n\n**[Download Latest IPA (IOS 17.6+)](https://github.com/Lolendor/LBox/releases/download/v1.2/LBox.ipa)**\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Overview\n\n**LBox** bridges the gap between finding apps and running them on iOS. Instead of manually searching for IPA files and moving them around the file system, LBox allows you to add repositories (similar to AltStore or ESign), download apps in the background, and automatically extract them into your LiveContainer storage.\n\n## \ud83d\udcf1 Screenshots\n\n| Store View | App Details | Downloads | Installed Apps |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| <img src=\"./screenshots/store.png\" width=\"200\" alt=\"Store View\"/> | <img src=\"./screenshots/app_details.png\" width=\"200\" alt=\"App Details\"/> | <img src=\"./screenshots/downloads.png\" width=\"200\" alt=\"Downloads\"/> | <img src=\"./screenshots/apps.png\" width=\"200\" alt=\"Apps\"/> |\n\n## \u2728 Key Features\n\n*   **Repository Management**:\n    *   Add and manage unlimited public repositories (JSON format).\n    *   **Remote Folders (Repo Lists)**: Subscribe to a single URL (text file) to automatically fetch and maintain a list of multiple repositories.\n    *   Organize sources into folders.\n    *   Import/Export repository lists via JSON or Clipboard.\n*   **App Management & Updates**:\n    *   **Update Detection**: Automatically compares installed apps with repository versions and notifies you of available updates.\n    *   **Smart Updates**: Update installed apps directly while **preserving user data** and configurations.\n    *   Auto-detects apps installed within the LiveContainer folder.\n    *   **One-tap Launch**: Open apps directly from LBox using the `livecontainer://` URL scheme.\n    *   **Auto-Install**: Automatically unzips and moves downloaded `.ipa` files to the specific LiveContainer application directory.\n*   **Download Manager**:\n    *   Robust background downloading with pause/resume support.\n    *   Direct download via URL (for IPAs hosted outside user repositories).\n    *   Visual progress tracking and local file management.\n*   **Version History**:\n    *   View and download specific versions of an app (downgrade/upgrade support).\n*   **Customization**:\n    *   Configure custom storage locations for Downloads and LiveContainer apps (using Security Scoped Bookmarks).\n    *   Search, filter, and sort apps by name, date, or size.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0 How it Works\n\n1.  **Initial Setup**: Upon first launch, LBox will ask for the LiveContainer directory. Select the root folder of your installed LiveContainer app. This step is required for auto-installation and launching apps.\n2.  **Add a Source**: Input a URL to a compliant app repository JSON **or** add a \"Folder\" utilizing a list URL to batch-import repos.\n3.  **Browse & Download**: Find the app you want and tap \"Get\". LBox handles the download in the background.\n4.  **Install/Update**: \n    *   **New Install**: LBox extracts the `.ipa` to your Applications folder.\n    *   **Update**: If the app exists, LBox offers to update it while keeping your documents and settings intact.\n5.  **Launch**: Navigate to the \"Apps\" tab and tap the app to run it instantly via LiveContainer.\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f Build Instructions\n\n### Prerequisites\n*   Mac with Xcode installed.\n*   An iOS device (Simulators may not fully support LiveContainer integration).\n*   [LiveContainer](https://github.com/khanhduytran0/LiveContainer) installed on the target device.\n\n### Installation\n1.  Clone the repository:\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LBox.git\n    ```\n2.  Open LBox.xcodeproj in Xcode.\n3.  Select your Development Team in the \"Signing & Capabilities\" tab.\n4.  Build and run on your device.\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Known Issues\n\n*   **\"App bundle not found! Unable to read LCAppInfo.plist\" Error**:\n    You may encounter this error popup immediately after installing an app and trying to launch it for the first time.\n    *   **Solution**: Simply dismiss the error and tap the **Run** button again. The app should launch successfully, and this error will not appear on subsequent launches.\n\n*   <a id=\"fix-file-picker\"></a>**Unable to select LiveContainer Directory**:\n    If the file picker does not appear or you cannot select a folder during the initial setup:\n    *   **Solution**: Open LiveContainer, find **LBox** in the \"My Apps\" list, press and hold the icon, tap **Settings**, and enable **Fix File Picker**. Then try selecting the directory again.\n    <img src=\"./screenshots/how_to_fix_file_picker.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Fix File Picker Settings\">\n\n## \ud83d\udcc2 File Structure\n\n*   AppData.swift: Handles repository parsing, app models, and data persistence.\n*   DownloadManager.swift: Manages URLSession tasks, file system operations, and zip extraction.\n*   ContentView.swift: The main navigation and UI entry point.\n*   AppDetailView.swift: Displays detailed app information, screenshots, and version history.\n\n## credits\n\n* Developed by Lolendor.\n* Designed to work with LiveContainer.\n\n## Support the project\n\nIf you find this project useful:\n\n- **TON / USDT (TON)**  `UQAyBchGEKi9NnNQ3AKMQMuO-SGEhMIAKFAbkwwrsiOPj9Gy`\n\n## \ud83d\udcc4 License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.\n",

                    "localizedDescription": "This is the fourth revision of beta 8.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* The Dolphin core has been updated to 2412.\r\n  * Save states made in previous beta versions are not compatible. GameCube memory cards and Wii in-game save files are not affected.\r\n* Added new app icons based off the macOS icon introduced in Dolphin 2407. (thanks Kongolabongo and @brand175 for the new iOS icons, and thanks MayImilae for the original macOS icon)\r\n* No JIT mode (**very slow**) has been added. (thanks @brand175)\r\n  * When launching a game without JIT enabled, you can now choose to start it in No JIT mode.\r\n  * The \"waiting for JIT\" screen can be bypassed entirely by manually changing the CPU Emulation Engine in Settings -> Config -> Advanced to Cached Interpreter.\r\n  * No JIT mode is **very slow**. You will need a high-end device (like a recent iPhone or iPad Pro) and to enable speed hacks (VBI Skip, CPU underclock, etc) to achieve playable speeds.\r\n* Added a button to import BootMii NAND backups in the software list.\r\n  * This is useful for those who want to play Wiimmfi online.\r\n  * No JIT users beware: Wiimmfi will ban devices that run below 100% emulation speed in Mario Kart Wii. We recommend that Wiimmfi should only be used in JIT mode.\r\n* Added experimental support for rootless jailbreaks. \r\n* Added a menu to check which buttons are being pressed on physical controllers when mapping buttons.\r\n* Ported \"Respect Silent Mode\" toggle from Delta.\r\n  * This setting controls whether DolphiniOS obeys the Ring/Silent switch on your device. If disabled, then audio will play even if silent mode is enabled.\r\n  * Find it in Settings -> Config -> Audio.  \r\n* Added Game Mode for devices running iOS 18.\r\n* Re-implemented the touch screen Wii pointer.\r\n  * A new default mode has been added: \"drag\". This mode allows you to use your touch screen like a laptop trackpad when moving the Wii pointer.\r\n  * The mode used in 3.2.1 and earlier is still available as \"follow\" mode.\r\n  * Choose the mode you want as default in the top bar menu during emulation or in Settings -> Controllers -> Touchscreen.\r\n* Re-implemented automatic disc changing.\r\n  * When a game asks for a different disc, DolphiniOS will automatically insert the correct disc into the emulated disc drive.\r\n  * Both disc files must be imported (i.e. in the Software folder and visible in the software list) for this feature to work properly.\r\n  * If it still does not work, ensure that \"Change Disc Automatically\" is enabled in Settings -> Config -> General.\r\n* Re-implemented the touch screen transparency level slider.\r\n* Re-implemented support for multiple save state slots.\r\n* Re-implemented the Open button in the software list.\r\n* Re-implemented the Delete button in the software list.\r\n* Re-implemented the Launch GameCube Main Menu button in the software list.\r\n* Matched the refresh rate of the `MTKView` to the display's refresh rate.\r\n  * GameCube and Wii games do not run above 30/60Hz.\r\n  * This is only for testing purposes.\r\n* Fixed many crashes, freezes, physics bugs, etc when using Cached Interpreter.\r\n  * The fix for this bug (disabling \"fast math\" mode in Xcode) will likely result in a slight performance decrease.\r\n  * While fast math does make math calculations run faster, it also causes [some calculations to return incorrect answers](https://simonbyrne.github.io/notes/fastmath/).\r\n  * Accuracy is vital when emulating software. When fast math returns a wrong answer for a calculation, it can cause crashing and other bugs in the emulated software, as they always expect to receive correct answers.\r\n  * For example, the Wii's System Menu immediately crashes when using Cached Interpreter in previous 4.0.0 beta builds, as the math used to calculate whether the pointer is hovering over a channel or not returns incorrect results. Disabling fast math fixes this issue.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the bottom of the \"waiting for JIT\" screen was cut off on some devices. (thanks @brand175)\r\n* Fixed an issue where booting Wii software during the first launch of the app could cause DolphiniOS to crash.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the state of the \"Enabled\" switch in the menu shown when mapping controller buttons does not save properly.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the toggle for VBI Skip in Settings was still using its old name, VI Skip.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the top bar could get dismissed while using the menu.\r\n  * This was fixed by removing the code which dismissed the top bar after 5 seconds.\r\n  * You now need to manually dismiss the top bar by pressing the \"eye with a slash through it\" icon.\r\n  * Unfortunately, there is no way to check to see if the menu is open, so this was the best solution I could come up with. \r\n* Fixed an issue where the software list was not refreshed when importing new software.\r\n* Fixed an issue where device motion did not apply to the Nunchuk.\r\n  * Users who are updating from an older beta version will need to re-import the Touchscreen default profile in Controllers to apply this bug fix.\r\n* Hid some options in the debug menu when DolphiniOS is built in release mode. \r\n* Updated MoltenVK to 1.2.8.\r\n  * [The latest version of MoltenVK is incompatible with Dolphin due to a bug](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/issues/2403).\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\n* Revision 2 was released shortly after the initial revision was published.\r\n  * Fixed a problem with the build creation process which caused builds to not show up on GitHub.\r\n* Revision 3 was released on Jan 17.\r\n  * Fixed a problem with the app icon not showing up on SpringBoard.\r\n  * Fixed a problem where the version number was not updated to beta 8.\r\n  * Fixed a problem where using Vulkan would cause colours to appear oversaturated until the app was restarted. (thanks @brand175)\r\n* Revision 4 was released shortly after Revision 3.\r\n  * Fixed a problem where the touch screen controller button images were not included in the app.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/OatmealDome/dolphin-ios/compare/v4.0.0b7...v4.0.0b8",

It is based off of QEMU. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Linux, and more on your Mac, iPhone, and iPad. More information at https://getutm.app/ and https://mac.getutm.app/\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"450px\" alt=\"UTM running on an iPhone\" src=\"screen.png\">\n  <br>\n  <img width=\"450px\" alt=\"UTM running on a MacBook\" src=\"screenmac.png\">\n</p>\n\n## Features\n\n* Full system emulation (MMU, devices, etc) using QEMU\n* 30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V\n* VGA graphics mode using SPICE and QXL\n* Text terminal mode\n* USB devices\n* JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG\n* Frontend designed from scratch for macOS 11 and iOS 11+ using the latest and greatest APIs\n* Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device\n\n## Additional macOS Features\n\n* Hardware accelerated virtualization using Hypervisor.framework and QEMU\n* Boot macOS guests with Virtualization.framework on macOS 12+\n\n## UTM SE\n\nUTM/QEMU requires dynamic code generation (JIT) for maximum performance. JIT on iOS devices require either a jailbroken device, or one of the various workarounds found for specific versions of iOS (see \"Install\" for more details).\n\nUTM SE (\"slow edition\") uses a [threaded interpreter][3] which performs better than a traditional interpreter but still slower than JIT. This technique is similar to what [iSH][4] does for dynamic execution. As a result, UTM SE does not require jailbreaking or any JIT workarounds and can be sideloaded as a regular app.\n\nTo optimize for size and build times, only the following architectures are included in UTM SE: ARM, PPC, RISC-V, and x86 (all with both 32-bit and 64-bit variants).\n\n## Install\n\nUTM (SE) for iOS: https://getutm.app/install/\n\nUTM is also available for macOS: https://mac.getutm.app/\n\n## Development\n\n### [macOS Development](Documentation/MacDevelopment.md)\n\n### [iOS Development](Documentation/iOSDevelopment.md)\n\n## Related\n\n* [iSH][4]: emulates a usermode Linux terminal interface for running x86 Linux applications on iOS\n* [a-shell][5]: packages common Unix commands and utilities built natively for iOS and accessible through a terminal interface\n\n## License\n\nUTM is distributed under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. However, it uses several (L)GPL components. Most are dynamically linked but the gstreamer plugins are statically linked and parts of the code are taken from qemu.

The updated wizard can create more working configurations such as RISC-V64 Ubuntu, classic Mac OS 8.x/9.x, and Windows 95/98.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.4)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash on VM start when a toolbar menu was reinitialized (note v4.7.4 was re-released to address this) (#7408)\r\n* Home: Fixed layout issue with button titles\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when VM exits while USB is active\r\n* (iOS) Support for StikDebug on iOS 26 (non-SE only)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM results in a block device error\r\n* Stop button can now be used a second time to force kill a VM if it is unresponsive after stopping for the first time\r\n* libusb: Fixed multiple race conditions that caused crashes when using USB capture\r\n* CocoaSpice: Fixed multiple race conditions that caused crashes during VM start\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed broken commands due to name collision (#7360)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when exiting full screen (#7377)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.2)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed a crash when starting any Apple Virtualization VM (#7355) (We are re-releasing v4.7.2 with build 112 due to this critical bug.)\r\n* Home: Display network details and active IP addresses on the home details screen (thanks @gabefair)\r\n* Home: Show a security warning message when importing a .utm with custom arguments (#6252)\r\n* Config: Option to reset UEFI without pre-loading Secure Boot keys (useful for custom TPM configurations) (#7005)\r\n* Config: Pre-loading Secure Boot keys will now install Microsoft UEFI 2023 certificates (#7257)\r\n* Config: When PS/2 device is enabled, no longer create USB mouse and keyboard devices. This allows older Windows install to work out of the box.\r\n* Config: Quotes in custom arguments are no longer stripped (unless the only quotes wrap the entire argument) (#6343)\r\n* Config: Provide a fixed serial number for VirtIO block devices (#7332)\r\n* QEMU: Fixed an issue which causes Windows 98 to BSoD (#7342)\r\n* QEMU: Do not create a default floppy drive when -nodefaults is used. UTM configuration will set up a FDC device and this is the only way to set up bootindex for floppy.\r\n* Wizard: Legacy Windows configurations will now use PS/2 controller by default\r\n* Wizard: Update OS logos to be consistent with other icons\r\n* Wizard: Windows + i440fx hardware will now instantiate default devices (sound, VGA, networking) that should work with Windows 95/98\r\n* Wizard: Add additional supported hardware configurations for running older Windows\r\n* Wizard: Support floppy boot for Windows configuration\r\n* Scripting: New input automation suite for sending keyboard and mouse input (#6462)\r\n* USB: Fixed a rare crash when initializing the USB devices list (#5811)\r\n* SPICE: Fixed an issue where monitor configuration sent to spice-vdagent contains an invalid size (#5832)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Fix foreground issue on iOS 26 beta 5 and higher\r\n* (macOS) Added ability to auto-connect USB devices on start (#3400)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed connecting USB devices from secondary windows\r\n* (macOS) New \"Virtual Machine\" menu which mirrors the actions accessible through the toolbar\r\n* (macOS) Keyboard Shortcuts toolbar icon is no longer shown by default (it can be placed on the toolbar through View -> Customize Toolbar). It is also accessible through the \"Virtual Machine\" menu.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed sending simultaneous mouse button presses (#7068)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Add `version` command to detect current UTM version\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New option to disable key swapping on ISO keyboards (#6976)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New option to randomize network MAC addresses on clone (#7035)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.1)\r\n* New Liquid Glass icon thanks to @forcequitOS\r\n* Added App Intents for VM operations (#6245)\r\n* Added UEFI boot support for RISC-V64 and LoongArch64. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* QEMU PPC: Disable `bootindex` when `boot-device` is used in prom-env. This allows Yellow Dog Linux for PPC to work out of the box. (#6436)\r\n* QEMU x86_64: Fixed floppy boot order configuration for other PC models (isapc, i440fx) (#7166)\r\n* QEMU PPC/M68K: Includes classicvirtio drivers to support cursor input without capture and directory sharing (#6520)\r\n* QEMU M68K: Fixed virtio drive config (#7008)\r\n* Fixed a rare crash after stopping VM due to a race condition in libusb\r\n* Home: improve screenshot contrast in Dark Mode (#6894)\r\n* Config: Fixed a crash when trying to enter a large size value when creating a new drive (#7295)\r\n* Config: Corrected the default host IP address in port forwarding config to \"0.0.0.0\" when it incorrectly displayed \"127.0.0.1\" (#7132)\r\n* Keyboard Shortcuts: Create custom combinations of keyboard shortcuts from either Settings -> Input or via the Keyboard icon in the VM (press and hold on iOS/visionOS). This will allow you to easily send key commands such as Ctrl+Alt+Del or Stop+A to the VM. (#5698, #6310, #6757)\r\n* Wizard: New option to import an existing drive image when setting up a Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: New option to create a serial port only Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: Removed VHDX import option because Microsoft now provides ARM64 ISO images. Note: You can still create manually import an VHDX after creating a new VM.\r\n* Wizard: New template to create classic Mac OS VMs for M68K and PPC (#3504, #6890)\r\n* Wizard: Most common and supported machines for emulation are now listed prominently with the full list of supported QEMU architectures/targets hidden behind an \"Expert\" mode. This is necessary because most of the QEMU targets are not properly supported by the wizard anyways and does not generate a bootable config. They usually require a lot more manual tinkering. The page order of the wizard is also tweaked so the hardware config comes before the boot config now.\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when launching ArchLinux due to mis-handling of REV32\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when the first instruction executed is a goto\r\n* (iOS SE) Removed ARM32, RISC-V32, and added M68K. There is little use for ARM32 and RISC-V32 as they cannot boot anything useful that cannot also be booted by the 64-bit variant (which is still included). If you have a counter example of this, please open an issue on GitHub and we can consider re-adding it back in the future. However, removing these will make the app size a lot smaller. M68K is added to support classic Mac OS.\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed guest tools mounting (#7297)\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed stop button not working (#7298)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a bug where an error message on startup leads to the window being stuck (#7161)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable file locking so VMs can be launched from a network share or a filesystem that does not support locking (#7211)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable screenshots completely for privacy reasons (#6620)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to swap Ctrl and Cmd keys in VMs (#4003)\r\n* (macOS 26) Settings: Brand new layout with a sidebar to match other native apps\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Added clearer message when trying to install macOS beta without having the latest beta support tools installed\r\n* (macOS) AVF: New option to resize (expand) disk images (#6891)\r\n* (macOS 26) Fixed a layout issue with the resize image popover\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed hide sidebar button\r\n* (macOS) Config: Show localized network adapter names when available (#7287) (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed an issue where wrong UUIDs were generated for display configs (#7145)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.0)\r\n* Updated to QEMU v10.0.2\r\n* Config: In the RAM slider, the maximum value has been increased to 64GiB (note that you can always go above the slider limit by typing in the text box) (#7234)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed crash when VM name is empty (#7245)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Refactored toolbar button layout code\r\n* (macOS) Host only networks: you can set up multiple host-only networks (including ones shared by VMware) and have multiple VMs on the same virtual network (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: added option to boot Apple VMs into recovery mode (thanks @cees-elzinga)\r\n* (macOS) ~~Enable QEMU support for vmapple (#7150)~~ Machine model is removed for stability reasons but `apple-gfx-pci` is still supported for Intel VMs\r\n* (macOS) Rename the main window to 'UTM Library' (#7264)\r\n* (macOS) Display an error when IPSW install fails to load the file (instead of crashing) (#6855)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: Fixed a layout issue (#7117)\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization: Add support for ASIF drive images.

This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* v4.6.5 reverted a change from v4.6.4 due to reports of crashes and kernel panics on some machines.

([#6794](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/6794))\r\n* There is a known issue ([#6332](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/6332)) with Windows 11 24H2 that causes the display to show a black screen or \"Guest has not initialized the display (yet)\" upon boot. We recommend not upgrading to 24H2 for existing installs and 23H2 for new installs. If you have already upgraded, please follow the workaround described in the linked issue.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* The update to QEMU v9.1.2 will likely introduce other issues and regressions. If you experience any problem (crashes, performance, errors) that was not evident in v4.5.x, please [open an issue](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and provide all the requested information. It would also be helpful if you can provide a reproducible example and note the last version of UTM where it worked properly.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.3)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a bug which caused Hypervisor to not work on supported devices\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a bug where the restored resolution gets re-scaled causing the window size to be incorrect (#6854, #6864)\r\n* (macOS) Workaround for a bizarre issue that causes QEMU VMs to not boot up because reading of the BIOS file results in failure\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.2)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v9.1.2 and fixed a crash during Windows setup (x86_64) (#6835)\r\n* Fixed a race condition that causes starting VM to fail with \"QMP stream error seen\"\r\n* (iOS) Fixed DEB install\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a crash when the main bundle executable is not the same as the currently running executable\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a crash on iOS 18 due to namespace collision with internal names\r\n* (iOS) Fixed auto-zoom to fill screen not properly working when Display Zoom is used (#6736)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed TSO mode not working in QEMU\r\n* (macOS) Fixed slow virtualization issues on Intel Macs (#6325)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed boot issues with Windows 11 24H2 (x86_64) (#6772)\r\n* (macOS) Support > 32GiB RAM configurations in QEMU (#5537)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.1)\r\n* Updated SPICE GTK to v0.42, libsoup to v3.6.0, and phodav to 3.0\r\n* Fixed an issue where an empty and broken .utm package is created when creation of VM fails\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* (macOS) Fix fullscreen button showing up as zoom when the dock icon is disabled (thanks @ntoskrnl) (#6269)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue \"With SME enabled, at least one vector length must be enabled.\" when an M4 series Mac is running macOS 15.2 beta (#6790)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed permission issue with EFI vars when installed with Nix (#6725)\r\n* (macOS 13) Enable changing shared directory for newer macOS guests (#6807)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a memory leak caused by an event listener not unregistering after the VM window is closed\r\n* (macOS) Support saving and restoring dynamic resolution when the guest supports it (both QEMU SPICE based and Apple Virtualization based guests)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: added new import and export commands to the Apple Script interface as well as extra QEMU args to the configuration for a new VM (thanks @naveenrajm7) (#6716, #6734, #6741)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed a crash when an invalid .utm package is found\r\n* (macOS 15) Virtualization: Fixed nested virtualization not being set (#6789)\r\n* (macOS 15) Virtualization: Support ejecting and changing removable drives while the VM is running\r\n* (macOS 15) Virtualization: Support installing guest tools for macOS guests\r\n* (macOS 15) Virtualization: Support copy-paste on macOS 15 guests when guest tools is installed\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed alerts not showing up\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed VM download confirmation not showing up when wizard is open (#6820)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.0)\r\n* Updated to QEMU v9.1.0\r\n* Fixed \"RPC timeout\" when stopping a VM\r\n* Fixed a race condition when cleaning up SPICE objects\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS 16+) Home: Always show the sidebar\r\n* (macOS 15) Enable nested virtualization when available\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM-HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM-SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n| UTM-Remote.ipa | Remote client | Any | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

Please update to the latest version of UTM.\r\n* **QEMU v9.1.2** The backend has been updated to the latest upstream QEMU which brings with it a variety of bug fixes and performance improvements.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Nested virtualization for Linux** Linux VMs using Apple Virtualization backend on macOS 15 and M3 or newer will now have nested virtualization enabled by default.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Total Store Ordering for QEMU** VMs using QEMU backend on macOS 15 can now enable TSO (in QEMU settings) at the hypervisor level. When TSO is enabled on a guest operating system that is aware of the system register (i.e. Rosetta for Linux), performance of Intel emulation within the guest can be greatly improved. Note that if the guest kernel supports dynamically toggling TSO, you do not need to enable this.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Improved macOS guest support** The last window size (including full screen size) will be restored when the guest supports dynamic resolution. Removable drives and shared directories can now be ejected and changed while the macOS VM is running. Copy/paste synchronization between macOS 15 guest and host now works when the guest tools are installed (from the CD icon in the toolbar).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue with macOS 15.0 and 15.0.1 where accesses to files will fail due to a permission error.

You do not need to update. \r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **macOS Sonoma support** New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore support for newer iOS** With the release of [TrollStore 2](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), this update brings JIT support for all iOS device that can run TrollStore. If (and only if) you are on at most iOS 16.3.1 AND your device is M1, M2, or A16, then you can also use the virtualization option. No other device or higher iOS version will likely ever be supported due to Apple [removing Hypervisor in iOS 16.4](http://twitter.com/utmapp/status/1708907045314035986). The only way around this is if Apple un-deletes the code (unlikely) or a jailbreak powerful enough to run a custom kernel is released (even more unlikely as this has never been done on a modern iOS device).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.5)\r\n* Fixed a \"device not found\" error when starting a VM with an empty interface (#5845)\r\n* Fixed JIT for TrollStore builds (#5216) (thanks @crstestacc)\r\n* Added support for virtualization on iOS 16.3.1 and lower (M1, M2, A16 only) (thanks @xliuxu)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed

not enable it by default (#5633)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: File sizes displayed are now the size occupied on disk to be more consistent with QEMU VMs (#5637)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed macOS installer not working when a shared directory is selected (#5634)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where shared directory cannot be selected from the home screen (#5617)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where the

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **macOS Sonoma support** New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **visionOS support** UTM is now working on visionOS but until we get our hands on a real device, it is TBD on how to actually run it. If you are a lucky owner of a development unit, you can try it out yourself with the provided IPAs.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.3)\r\n* Guest Tools: supports caching the latest version and will only re-download when a newer version is available (#5692)\r\n* Fixed a bug where a suspended QEMU VM with a locked CD drive will refuse to resume\r\n* Localization: Updated Russian (thanks @s0rd3s)\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed display scaling sometimes not applying\r\n* (visionOS) Reimplemented multiple-window support with newer APIs and fixes an issue where the main window is resized on startup to the last VM display size\r\n* (visionOS) Process gaze touch events as indirect input\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard button was not opening the keyboard and sometimes causes the keyboard to keep popping up after being closed\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where `efi_vars.fd` is locked when the QEMU process deadlocks (#5769)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.2)\r\n* Added some default devices for PPC64 (#5737, #5734)\r\n* Fixed an issue where some VMs refuse to boot (#5745)\r\n*

To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n* If you suspended an Apple Virtualization VM in v4.4 and then downgrade to v4.3, you will not be able to resume the VM or start it at all. Please make sure you shut down any such VMs before downgrading or you may suffer data loss.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices. However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.\r\n* Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.\r\n* Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)\r\n* Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved\r\n* Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)\r\n* Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)\r\n* Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters\r\n* Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation\r\n* Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.\r\n* Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release\r\n* Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically. This addresses an error that shows up if the Documents directory does not get created properly by macOS. (#5419)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where TSO setting was not saved\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where every time a VM is started with a terminal window, the width of the window gets a bit larger\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where starting a stopped VM does not change the display scale\r\n* (macOS) AVM: System keys will be captured automatically when entering full screen and released when exiting full screen (#3668)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Fixed the request stop method in both the GUI and scripting interfaces (#5425)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.1)\r\n* Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.2\r\n* Refactored QEMU support to a new project: [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit)\r\n* Machines with IDE interface (i44FX/PIIX) will now support two units per bus. Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings. (#5358)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @studio1a9)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when AVM window is closed (#5347)\r\n* (macOS) New option \u201cAutomatic\u201d for bridged network connection which will use the bridge the first active connection on the host. Both AVM and QEMU backends are supported. (#5410)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed trackpad setting not saving (#5369)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.0)\r\n* Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.0\r\n* Changed audio backend from CoreAudio back to SPICE (as it was before v4.2.x). Clarify that CoreAudio backend does not support microphone (#5253)\r\n* Add support for mouse buttons 4 and 5 (#5295)\r\n* Wizard: Properly display an error message when there is a failure writing to disk (#5271)\r\n* Fixed an issue where ISAPC emulation target cannot be started (#5280)\r\n* Fixed CoreAudio being instantiated even when audio is disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where legacy VMs with AC97 sound card has an empty name in settings\r\n* Fixed an QEMU issue where the `ucomiss` instruction causes a crash in some applications (#5294)\r\n* Fixed an issue preventing VMs with commas in their name from starting (note only new VMs will be fixed) (#5332)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Support canceling macOS installation\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Added `delete` command (#5290)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue creating a shortcut from drag & drop as well as double clicking from Finder (#5310, #5311)\r\n* (macOS) Added DHCP start/end settings for vmnet (#5301)\r\n* (macOS) Added automatically syncing of system clock when macOS wakes up from sleep (when QEMU guest agent is installed) (#5252)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM.HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices. However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.\r\n* Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.\r\n* Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)\r\n* Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved\r\n* Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)\r\n* Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)\r\n* Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters\r\n* Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation\r\n* Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.\r\n* Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release\r\n* Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically. This addresses an error that shows up if the Documents directory does not get created properly by macOS. (#5419)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where TSO setting was not saved\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where every time a VM is started with a terminal window, the width of the window gets a bit larger\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where starting a stopped VM does not change the display scale\r\n* (macOS) AVM: System keys will be captured automatically when entering full screen and released when exiting full screen (#3668)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Fixed the request stop method in both the GUI and scripting interfaces (#5425)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.1)\r\n* Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.2\r\n* Refactored QEMU support to a new project: [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit)\r\n* Machines with IDE interface (i44FX/PIIX) will now support two units per bus. Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings. (#5358)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @studio1a9)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when AVM window is closed (#5347)\r\n* (macOS) New option \u201cAutomatic\u201d for bridged network connection which will use the bridge the first active connection on the host. Both AVM and QEMU backends are supported. (#5410)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed trackpad setting not saving (#5369)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.0)\r\n* Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.0\r\n* Changed audio backend from CoreAudio back to SPICE (as it was before v4.2.x). Clarify that CoreAudio backend does not support microphone (#5253)\r\n* Add support for mouse buttons 4 and 5 (#5295)\r\n* Wizard: Properly display an error message when there is a failure writing to disk (#5271)\r\n* Fixed an issue where ISAPC emulation target cannot be started (#5280)\r\n* Fixed CoreAudio being instantiated even when audio is disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where legacy VMs with AC97 sound card has an empty name in settings\r\n* Fixed an QEMU issue where the `ucomiss` instruction causes a crash in some applications (#5294)\r\n* Fixed an issue preventing VMs with commas in their name from starting (note only new VMs will be fixed) (#5332)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Support canceling macOS installation\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Added `delete` command (#5290)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue creating a shortcut from drag & drop as well as double clicking from Finder (#5310, #5311)\r\n* (macOS) Added DHCP start/end settings for vmnet (#5301)\r\n* (macOS) Added automatically syncing of system clock when macOS wakes up from sleep (when QEMU guest agent is installed) (#5252)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM.HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.5)\r\n* Reverted ANGLE to an older version which includes the fix detailed in v4.2.4 but also does not break the Metal backend (#5238)\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj, @mavethee)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the pointer device stopped working on macOS Monterey guests (#5237)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Added option to use emulated trackpad (requires macOS Ventura guest)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console.

It is based off of QEMU. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Linux, and more on your Mac, iPhone, and iPad. More information at https://getutm.app/ and https://mac.getutm.app/\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"450px\" alt=\"UTM running on an iPhone\" src=\"screen.png\">\n  <br>\n  <img width=\"450px\" alt=\"UTM running on a MacBook\" src=\"screenmac.png\">\n</p>\n\n## Features\n\n* Full system emulation (MMU, devices, etc) using QEMU\n* 30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V\n* VGA graphics mode using SPICE and QXL\n* Text terminal mode\n* USB devices\n* JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG\n* Frontend designed from scratch for macOS 11 and iOS 11+ using the latest and greatest APIs\n* Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device\n\n## Additional macOS Features\n\n* Hardware accelerated virtualization using Hypervisor.framework and QEMU\n* Boot macOS guests with Virtualization.framework on macOS 12+\n\n## UTM SE\n\nUTM/QEMU requires dynamic code generation (JIT) for maximum performance. JIT on iOS devices require either a jailbroken device, or one of the various workarounds found for specific versions of iOS (see \"Install\" for more details).\n\nUTM SE (\"slow edition\") uses a [threaded interpreter][3] which performs better than a traditional interpreter but still slower than JIT. This technique is similar to what [iSH][4] does for dynamic execution. As a result, UTM SE does not require jailbreaking or any JIT workarounds and can be sideloaded as a regular app.\n\nTo optimize for size and build times, only the following architectures are included in UTM SE: ARM, PPC, RISC-V, and x86 (all with both 32-bit and 64-bit variants).\n\n## Install\n\nUTM (SE) for iOS: https://getutm.app/install/\n\nUTM is also available for macOS: https://mac.getutm.app/\n\n## Development\n\n### [macOS Development](Documentation/MacDevelopment.md)\n\n### [iOS Development](Documentation/iOSDevelopment.md)\n\n## Related\n\n* [iSH][4]: emulates a usermode Linux terminal interface for running x86 Linux applications on iOS\n* [a-shell][5]: packages common Unix commands and utilities built natively for iOS and accessible through a terminal interface\n\n## License\n\nUTM is distributed under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. However, it uses several (L)GPL components. Most are dynamically linked but the gstreamer plugins are statically linked and parts of the code are taken from qemu.

The updated wizard can create more working configurations such as RISC-V64 Ubuntu, classic Mac OS 8.x/9.x, and Windows 95/98.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.4)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash on VM start when a toolbar menu was reinitialized (note v4.7.4 was re-released to address this) (#7408)\r\n* Home: Fixed layout issue with button titles\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when VM exits while USB is active\r\n* (iOS) Support for StikDebug on iOS 26 (non-SE only)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM results in a block device error\r\n* Stop button can now be used a second time to force kill a VM if it is unresponsive after stopping for the first time\r\n* libusb: Fixed multiple race conditions that caused crashes when using USB capture\r\n* CocoaSpice: Fixed multiple race conditions that caused crashes during VM start\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed broken commands due to name collision (#7360)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when exiting full screen (#7377)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.2)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed a crash when starting any Apple Virtualization VM (#7355) (We are re-releasing v4.7.2 with build 112 due to this critical bug.)\r\n* Home: Display network details and active IP addresses on the home details screen (thanks @gabefair)\r\n* Home: Show a security warning message when importing a .utm with custom arguments (#6252)\r\n* Config: Option to reset UEFI without pre-loading Secure Boot keys (useful for custom TPM configurations) (#7005)\r\n* Config: Pre-loading Secure Boot keys will now install Microsoft UEFI 2023 certificates (#7257)\r\n* Config: When PS/2 device is enabled, no longer create USB mouse and keyboard devices. This allows older Windows install to work out of the box.\r\n* Config: Quotes in custom arguments are no longer stripped (unless the only quotes wrap the entire argument) (#6343)\r\n* Config: Provide a fixed serial number for VirtIO block devices (#7332)\r\n* QEMU: Fixed an issue which causes Windows 98 to BSoD (#7342)\r\n* QEMU: Do not create a default floppy drive when -nodefaults is used. UTM configuration will set up a FDC device and this is the only way to set up bootindex for floppy.\r\n* Wizard: Legacy Windows configurations will now use PS/2 controller by default\r\n* Wizard: Update OS logos to be consistent with other icons\r\n* Wizard: Windows + i440fx hardware will now instantiate default devices (sound, VGA, networking) that should work with Windows 95/98\r\n* Wizard: Add additional supported hardware configurations for running older Windows\r\n* Wizard: Support floppy boot for Windows configuration\r\n* Scripting: New input automation suite for sending keyboard and mouse input (#6462)\r\n* USB: Fixed a rare crash when initializing the USB devices list (#5811)\r\n* SPICE: Fixed an issue where monitor configuration sent to spice-vdagent contains an invalid size (#5832)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Fix foreground issue on iOS 26 beta 5 and higher\r\n* (macOS) Added ability to auto-connect USB devices on start (#3400)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed connecting USB devices from secondary windows\r\n* (macOS) New \"Virtual Machine\" menu which mirrors the actions accessible through the toolbar\r\n* (macOS) Keyboard Shortcuts toolbar icon is no longer shown by default (it can be placed on the toolbar through View -> Customize Toolbar). It is also accessible through the \"Virtual Machine\" menu.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed sending simultaneous mouse button presses (#7068)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Add `version` command to detect current UTM version\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New option to disable key swapping on ISO keyboards (#6976)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New option to randomize network MAC addresses on clone (#7035)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.1)\r\n* New Liquid Glass icon thanks to @forcequitOS\r\n* Added App Intents for VM operations (#6245)\r\n* Added UEFI boot support for RISC-V64 and LoongArch64. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* QEMU PPC: Disable `bootindex` when `boot-device` is used in prom-env. This allows Yellow Dog Linux for PPC to work out of the box. (#6436)\r\n* QEMU x86_64: Fixed floppy boot order configuration for other PC models (isapc, i440fx) (#7166)\r\n* QEMU PPC/M68K: Includes classicvirtio drivers to support cursor input without capture and directory sharing (#6520)\r\n* QEMU M68K: Fixed virtio drive config (#7008)\r\n* Fixed a rare crash after stopping VM due to a race condition in libusb\r\n* Home: improve screenshot contrast in Dark Mode (#6894)\r\n* Config: Fixed a crash when trying to enter a large size value when creating a new drive (#7295)\r\n* Config: Corrected the default host IP address in port forwarding config to \"0.0.0.0\" when it incorrectly displayed \"127.0.0.1\" (#7132)\r\n* Keyboard Shortcuts: Create custom combinations of keyboard shortcuts from either Settings -> Input or via the Keyboard icon in the VM (press and hold on iOS/visionOS). This will allow you to easily send key commands such as Ctrl+Alt+Del or Stop+A to the VM. (#5698, #6310, #6757)\r\n* Wizard: New option to import an existing drive image when setting up a Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: New option to create a serial port only Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: Removed VHDX import option because Microsoft now provides ARM64 ISO images. Note: You can still create manually import an VHDX after creating a new VM.\r\n* Wizard: New template to create classic Mac OS VMs for M68K and PPC (#3504, #6890)\r\n* Wizard: Most common and supported machines for emulation are now listed prominently with the full list of supported QEMU architectures/targets hidden behind an \"Expert\" mode. This is necessary because most of the QEMU targets are not properly supported by the wizard anyways and does not generate a bootable config. They usually require a lot more manual tinkering. The page order of the wizard is also tweaked so the hardware config comes before the boot config now.\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when launching ArchLinux due to mis-handling of REV32\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when the first instruction executed is a goto\r\n* (iOS SE) Removed ARM32, RISC-V32, and added M68K. There is little use for ARM32 and RISC-V32 as they cannot boot anything useful that cannot also be booted by the 64-bit variant (which is still included). If you have a counter example of this, please open an issue on GitHub and we can consider re-adding it back in the future. However, removing these will make the app size a lot smaller. M68K is added to support classic Mac OS.\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed guest tools mounting (#7297)\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed stop button not working (#7298)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a bug where an error message on startup leads to the window being stuck (#7161)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable file locking so VMs can be launched from a network share or a filesystem that does not support locking (#7211)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable screenshots completely for privacy reasons (#6620)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to swap Ctrl and Cmd keys in VMs (#4003)\r\n* (macOS 26) Settings: Brand new layout with a sidebar to match other native apps\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Added clearer message when trying to install macOS beta without having the latest beta support tools installed\r\n* (macOS) AVF: New option to resize (expand) disk images (#6891)\r\n* (macOS 26) Fixed a layout issue with the resize image popover\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed hide sidebar button\r\n* (macOS) Config: Show localized network adapter names when available (#7287) (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed an issue where wrong UUIDs were generated for display configs (#7145)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.0)\r\n* Updated to QEMU v10.0.2\r\n* Config: In the RAM slider, the maximum value has been increased to 64GiB (note that you can always go above the slider limit by typing in the text box) (#7234)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed crash when VM name is empty (#7245)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Refactored toolbar button layout code\r\n* (macOS) Host only networks: you can set up multiple host-only networks (including ones shared by VMware) and have multiple VMs on the same virtual network (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: added option to boot Apple VMs into recovery mode (thanks @cees-elzinga)\r\n* (macOS) ~~Enable QEMU support for vmapple (#7150)~~ Machine model is removed for stability reasons but `apple-gfx-pci` is still supported for Intel VMs\r\n* (macOS) Rename the main window to 'UTM Library' (#7264)\r\n* (macOS) Display an error when IPSW install fails to load the file (instead of crashing) (#6855)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: Fixed a layout issue (#7117)\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization: Add support for ASIF drive images. On macOS 26, ASIF drives will be created by default.\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM-HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM-SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n| UTM-Remote.ipa | Remote client | Any | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

When TSO is enabled on a guest operating system that is aware of the system register (i.e. Rosetta for Linux), performance of Intel emulation within the guest can be greatly improved. Note that if the guest kernel supports dynamically toggling TSO, you do not need to enable this.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Improved macOS guest support** The last window size (including full screen size) will be restored when the guest supports dynamic resolution. Removable drives and shared directories can now be ejected and changed while the macOS VM is running. Copy/paste synchronization between macOS 15 guest and host now works when the guest tools are installed (from the CD icon in the toolbar).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue with macOS 15.0 and 15.0.1 where accesses to files will fail due to a permission error. This issue has been resolved with macOS 15.1.\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue on M4 series of Macs where virtualization fails for macOS guests older than 13.4. The issue has been resolved with macOS 15.2.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* v4.6.5 reverted a change from v4.6.4 due to reports of crashes and kernel panics on some machines. As a result, there will be issues when upgrading to Windows 11 24H2 where the screen will go black. An alternative fix with an updated driver will be provided as soon as possible, but for now if you plan to upgrade to Windows 11 24H2, it is recommended you do it from v4.6.4 before updating UTM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.5)\r\n* Reverted virtio-ramfb changes from v4.6.4 due to some users experiencing crashes and kernel panics. An alternative fix to the black screen issue will come in a Windows Guest Support driver update in the future. Until that is released, issue #6332 and #6883 will be unfixed.

Copy/paste synchronization between macOS 15 guest and host now works when the guest tools are installed (from the CD icon in the toolbar).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue with macOS 15.0 and 15.0.1 where accesses to files will fail due to a permission error. This issue has been resolved with macOS 15.1.\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue on M4 series of Macs where virtualization fails for macOS guests older than 13.4. The issue has been resolved with macOS 15.2.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.4)\r\n* Fixed an issue with virtio-ramfb device where Windows may sometimes try to render to an inactive display target causing black screen, \"Guest has not initialized the display (yet)\", or broken cursor. This sometimes happens right after installing the viogpudo drivers for the first time and more recently while upgrading to Windows 11 24H2.

                    "localizedDescription": "**macOS Users:** there is no difference between v4.4.4 and v4.4.5. You do not need to update. \r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **macOS Sonoma support** New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore support for newer iOS** With the release of [TrollStore 2](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), this update brings JIT support for all iOS device that can run TrollStore. If (and only if) you are on at most iOS 16.3.1 AND your device is M1, M2, or A16, then you can also use the virtualization option. No other device or higher iOS version will likely ever be supported due to Apple [removing Hypervisor in iOS 16.4](http://twitter.com/utmapp/status/1708907045314035986). The only way around this is if Apple un-deletes the code (unlikely) or a jailbreak powerful enough to run a custom kernel is released (even more unlikely as this has never been done on a modern iOS device).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.5)\r\n* Fixed a \"device not found\" error when starting a VM with an empty interface (#5845)\r\n* Fixed JIT for TrollStore builds (#5216) (thanks @crstestacc)\r\n* Added support for virtualization on iOS 16.3.1 and lower (M1, M2, A16 only) (thanks @xliuxu)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed keyboard device not showing up on older macOS guests (#5814)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.3)\r\n* Guest Tools: supports caching the latest version and will only re-download when a newer version is available (#5692)\r\n* Fixed a bug where a suspended QEMU VM with a locked CD drive will refuse to resume\r\n* Localization: Updated Russian (thanks @s0rd3s)\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed display scaling sometimes not applying\r\n* (visionOS) Reimplemented multiple-window support with newer APIs and fixes an issue where the main window is resized on startup to the last VM display size\r\n* (visionOS) Process gaze touch events as indirect input\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard button was not opening the keyboard and sometimes causes the keyboard to keep popping up after being closed\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where `efi_vars.fd` is locked when the QEMU process deadlocks (#5769)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.2)\r\n* Added some default devices for PPC64 (#5737, #5734)\r\n* Fixed an issue where some VMs refuse to boot (#5745)\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed a memory leak due to a retain cycle\r\n* Fixed an issue where ejecting an ISO or removing a shared directory does not sync after saving (#5708)\r\n* Localization: Added Russian (thanks @s0rd3s)\r\n* Localization: Added Chinese (Hong Kong) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Traditional) (thanks

Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed keyboard device not showing up on older macOS guests (#5814)\r\n\r\n## Changes

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n* If you suspended an Apple Virtualization VM in v4.4 and then downgrade to v4.3, you will not be able to resume the VM or start it at all. Please make sure you shut down any such VMs before downgrading or you may suffer data loss.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices.

Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings. (#5358)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @studio1a9)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when AVM window is closed (#5347)\r\n* (macOS) New option \u201cAutomatic\u201d for bridged network connection which will use the bridge the first active connection on the host.

                    "localizedDescription": "This version is broken due to a bug which prevents VMs from starting. Please update UTM to the latest version. If you obtained UTM from the Mac App Store, you may need to open the [App Store](itms-apps://apps.apple.com/updates) to the Updates tab to see it.\r\n\r\n## Highlights (Original)\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v8.0.2**\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nOn i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE.

Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.5)\r\n* Reverted ANGLE to an older version which includes the fix detailed in v4.2.4 but also does not break the Metal backend (#5238)\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj, @mavethee)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the pointer device stopped working on macOS Monterey guests (#5237)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Added option to use emulated trackpad (requires macOS Ventura guest)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`. You should now use similar properties in the `configuration` record\r\n* (macOS) Support changing the audio backend to CoreAudio and make CoreAudio the default (due to better latency and as a workaround to some crashes) (#5125)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.1)\r\n* QEMU: Support more than 8 cores for ARM64 targets (#4847)\r\n* Synchronize time on resume when QEMU guest agent is installed which should fix clock drift issues (#3218)\r\n* (iOS SE) Updated TCTI to latest branch from @ktemkin which has support for vector instructions (#4865)\r\n* (macOS) Switch to emulated trackpad when guest+host are macOS 13+ (second attempt for #4636 and #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the \"raw image\" checkbox when creating a new drive (#5100)\r\n* (macOS) Add PC speaker sound device as an option. You can now add a second sound device on supported targets (x86_64/i386 PC based targets) and set the hardware to PC Speaker to emulate older motherboard speakers.\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: new verbs \"open file\", \"execute\", and \"query ip\" which uses the QEMU guest agent to send commands to the guest. Use the Apple Script Editor's Open Dictionary tool for more information.\r\n* (macOS) CLI: new commands \"file push\", \"file pull\", \"exec\", and \"ip-address\". See `utmctl help` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.0)\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest (27/02/2023) commit\r\n* Automatically revert CPU to \"default\" if model is missing due to updated QEMU (#4910)\r\n* ~~Remove virtio-bus devices (they didn't work) (#4893)~~\r\n* Support drag and drop to import an .utm package (#3599)\r\n* Support copying sparse images across different volumes (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed tearing/performance issue for non-GL accelerated displays when under graphics load (#5049)\r\n* Fixed error when importing a new drive with the same name as an existing drive (#5052)\r\n* ~~Fixed a crash on startup when multiple audio devices are plugged in (#4629)~~\r\n* Wizard: Generate a working configuration for isapc (#4961)\r\n* Settings: Use pretty labels for CPU flags (#4940)\r\n* Translation: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Translation: added Czech readme (thanks @stinovlasmp)\r\n* Translation: updated German (thanks @LostInCompilation and @afh)\r\n* (macOS) Capture Mouse has been renamed to Capture Input and now will show the current capture status as a toggle button\r\n* (macOS) Apple VMs (macOS guests) now support Capture Input which will capture the system keys. This used to be always on as the default. It is now off by default and the toggle button will enable it. (#4667)\r\n* (macOS) Ignore missing links (drives, shared directory, etc) when saving an Apple VM\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to force Num Lock on (#4625)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to prevent idle sleep while VM is running (#4963)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to suppress exit confirmation (#4989)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed delete drive confirmation not showing up on latest macOS\r\n* (macOS) Fixed disposable mode stuck on when a VM is run once in disposable mode (#5025)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where a moved or deleted VM with a stopped window open will attempt to use the old path (#4985)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed cursor scrolling and double click issues (#4636, #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Support following a change in system default input or output audio device (#3488)\r\n* (macOS) Support retry of macOS installation when it fails (the IPSW will not automatically be unlinked)\r\n* (macOS) Support retaining of installer IPSW bookmark across VM moves and UTM restarts (#4938)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n* There is a known bug in newer versions of Mesa which prevents some Wayland applications (such as Firefox) from launching when GPU acceleration is enabled. One workaround is to switch to Xorg from the log-in screen (typically by clicking on the gear icon) and another is to patch Mesa to a newer version.\r\n* Debian 12 fails to load the GUI installer when GPU acceleration is enabled.

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* (iOS SE) **TCTI backend updates**. Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`. You should now use similar properties in the `configuration` record\r\n* (macOS) Support changing the audio backend to CoreAudio and make CoreAudio the default (due to better latency and as a workaround to some crashes) (#5125)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.1)\r\n* QEMU: Support more than 8 cores for ARM64 targets (#4847)\r\n* Synchronize time on resume when QEMU guest agent is installed which should fix clock drift issues (#3218)\r\n* (iOS SE) Updated TCTI to latest branch from @ktemkin which has support for vector instructions (#4865)\r\n* (macOS) Switch to emulated trackpad when guest+host are macOS 13+ (second attempt for #4636 and #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the \"raw image\" checkbox when creating a new drive (#5100)\r\n* (macOS) Add PC speaker sound device as an option. You can now add a second sound device on supported targets (x86_64/i386 PC based targets) and set the hardware to PC Speaker to emulate older motherboard speakers.\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: new verbs \"open file\", \"execute\", and \"query ip\" which uses the QEMU guest agent to send commands to the guest. Use the Apple Script Editor's Open Dictionary tool for more information.\r\n* (macOS) CLI: new commands \"file push\", \"file pull\", \"exec\", and \"ip-address\". See `utmctl help` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.0)\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest (27/02/2023) commit\r\n* Automatically revert CPU to \"default\" if model is missing due to updated QEMU (#4910)\r\n* ~~Remove virtio-bus devices (they didn't work) (#4893)~~\r\n* Support drag and drop to import an .utm package (#3599)\r\n* Support copying sparse images across different volumes (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed tearing/performance issue for non-GL accelerated displays when under graphics load (#5049)\r\n* Fixed error when importing a new drive with the same name as an existing drive (#5052)\r\n* ~~Fixed a crash on startup when multiple audio devices are plugged in (#4629)~~\r\n* Wizard: Generate a working configuration for isapc (#4961)\r\n* Settings: Use pretty labels for CPU flags (#4940)\r\n* Translation: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Translation: added Czech readme (thanks @stinovlasmp)\r\n* Translation: updated German (thanks @LostInCompilation and @afh)\r\n* (macOS) Capture Mouse has been renamed to Capture Input and now will show the current capture status as a toggle button\r\n* (macOS) Apple VMs (macOS guests) now support Capture Input which will capture the system keys. This used to be always on as the default. It is now off by default and the toggle button will enable it. (#4667)\r\n* (macOS) Ignore missing links (drives, shared directory, etc) when saving an Apple VM\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to force Num Lock on (#4625)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to prevent idle sleep while VM is running (#4963)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to suppress exit confirmation (#4989)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed delete drive confirmation not showing up on latest macOS\r\n* (macOS) Fixed disposable mode stuck on when a VM is run once in disposable mode (#5025)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where a moved or deleted VM with a stopped window open will attempt to use the old path (#4985)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed cursor scrolling and double click issues (#4636, #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Support following a change in system default input or output audio device (#3488)\r\n* (macOS) Support retry of macOS installation when it fails (the IPSW will not automatically be unlinked)\r\n* (macOS) Support retaining of installer IPSW bookmark across VM moves and UTM restarts (#4938)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n* There is a known bug in newer versions of Mesa which prevents some Wayland applications (such as Firefox) from launching when GPU acceleration is enabled. One workaround is to switch to Xorg from the log-in screen (typically by clicking on the gear icon) and another is to patch Mesa to a newer version.\r\n* Debian 12 fails to load the GUI installer when GPU acceleration is enabled. Please use the text installer instead.\r\n* The Metal renderer backend is broken on macOS, please change your renderer to OpenGL or \"Default\"\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM.HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

It is based off of QEMU. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Linux, and more on your Mac, iPhone, and iPad. More information at https://getutm.app/ and https://mac.getutm.app/\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"450px\" alt=\"UTM running on an iPhone\" src=\"screen.png\">\n  <br>\n  <img width=\"450px\" alt=\"UTM running on a MacBook\" src=\"screenmac.png\">\n</p>\n\n## Features\n\n* Full system emulation (MMU, devices, etc) using QEMU\n* 30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V\n* VGA graphics mode using SPICE and QXL\n* Text terminal mode\n* USB devices\n* JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG\n* Frontend designed from scratch for macOS 11 and iOS 11+ using the latest and greatest APIs\n* Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device\n\n## Additional macOS Features\n\n* Hardware accelerated virtualization using Hypervisor.framework and QEMU\n* Boot macOS guests with Virtualization.framework on macOS 12+\n\n## UTM SE\n\nUTM/QEMU requires dynamic code generation (JIT) for maximum performance. JIT on iOS devices require either a jailbroken device, or one of the various workarounds found for specific versions of iOS (see \"Install\" for more details).\n\nUTM SE (\"slow edition\") uses a [threaded interpreter][3] which performs better than a traditional interpreter but still slower than JIT. This technique is similar to what [iSH][4] does for dynamic execution. As a result, UTM SE does not require jailbreaking or any JIT workarounds and can be sideloaded as a regular app.\n\nTo optimize for size and build times, only the following architectures are included in UTM SE: ARM, PPC, RISC-V, and x86 (all with both 32-bit and 64-bit variants).\n\n## Install\n\nUTM (SE) for iOS: https://getutm.app/install/\n\nUTM is also available for macOS: https://mac.getutm.app/\n\n## Development\n\n### [macOS Development](Documentation/MacDevelopment.md)\n\n### [iOS Development](Documentation/iOSDevelopment.md)\n\n## Related\n\n* [iSH][4]: emulates a usermode Linux terminal interface for running x86 Linux applications on iOS\n* [a-shell][5]: packages common Unix commands and utilities built natively for iOS and accessible through a terminal interface\n\n## License\n\nUTM is distributed under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.

This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* QEMU PPC: Disable `bootindex` when `boot-device` is used in prom-env. This allows Yellow Dog Linux for PPC to work out of the box. (#6436)\r\n* QEMU x86_64: Fixed floppy boot order configuration for other PC models (isapc, i440fx) (#7166)\r\n* QEMU PPC/M68K: Includes classicvirtio drivers to support cursor input without capture and directory sharing (#6520)\r\n* QEMU M68K: Fixed virtio drive config (#7008)\r\n* Fixed a rare crash after stopping VM due to a race condition in libusb\r\n* Home: improve screenshot contrast in Dark Mode (#6894)\r\n* Config: Fixed a crash when trying to enter a large size value when creating a new drive (#7295)\r\n* Config: Corrected the default host IP address in port forwarding config to \"0.0.0.0\" when it incorrectly displayed \"127.0.0.1\" (#7132)\r\n* Keyboard Shortcuts: Create custom combinations of keyboard shortcuts from either Settings -> Input or via the Keyboard icon in the VM (press and hold on iOS/visionOS). This will allow you to easily send key commands such as Ctrl+Alt+Del or Stop+A to the VM. (#5698, #6310, #6757)\r\n* Wizard: New option to import an existing drive image when setting up a Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: New option to create a serial port only Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: Removed VHDX import option because Microsoft now provides ARM64 ISO images. Note: You can still create manually import an VHDX after creating a new VM.\r\n* Wizard: New template to create classic Mac OS VMs for M68K and PPC (#3504, #6890)\r\n* Wizard: Most common and supported machines for emulation are now listed prominently with the full list of supported QEMU architectures/targets hidden behind an \"Expert\" mode. This is necessary because most of the QEMU targets are not properly supported by the wizard anyways and does not generate a bootable config. They usually require a lot more manual tinkering. The page order of the wizard is also tweaked so the hardware config comes before the boot config now.\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when launching ArchLinux due to mis-handling of REV32\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when the first instruction executed is a goto\r\n* (iOS SE) Removed ARM32, RISC-V32, and added M68K. There is little use for ARM32 and RISC-V32 as they cannot boot anything useful that cannot also be booted by the 64-bit variant (which is still included). If you have a counter example of this, please open an issue on GitHub and we can consider re-adding it back in the future. However, removing these will make the app size a lot smaller. M68K is added to support classic Mac OS.\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed guest tools mounting (#7297)\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed stop button not working (#7298)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a bug where an error message on startup leads to the window being stuck (#7161)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable file locking so VMs can be launched from a network share or a filesystem that does not support locking (#7211)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable screenshots completely for privacy reasons (#6620)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to swap Ctrl and Cmd keys in VMs (#4003)\r\n* (macOS 26) Settings: Brand new layout with a sidebar to match other native apps\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Added clearer message when trying to install macOS beta without having the latest beta support tools installed\r\n* (macOS) AVF: New option to resize (expand) disk images (#6891)\r\n* (macOS 26) Fixed a layout issue with the resize image popover\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed hide sidebar button\r\n* (macOS) Config: Show localized network adapter names when available (#7287) (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed an issue where wrong UUIDs were generated for display configs (#7145)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.0)\r\n* Updated to QEMU v10.0.2\r\n* Config: In the RAM slider, the maximum value has been increased to 64GiB (note that you can always go above the slider limit by typing in the text box) (#7234)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed crash when VM name is empty (#7245)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Refactored toolbar button layout code\r\n* (macOS) Host only networks: you can set up multiple host-only networks (including ones shared by VMware) and have multiple VMs on the same virtual network (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: added option to boot Apple VMs into recovery mode (thanks @cees-elzinga)\r\n* (macOS) ~~Enable QEMU support for vmapple (#7150)~~ Machine model is removed for stability reasons but `apple-gfx-pci` is still supported for Intel VMs\r\n* (macOS) Rename the main window to 'UTM Library' (#7264)\r\n* (macOS) Display an error when IPSW install fails to load the file (instead of crashing) (#6855)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: Fixed a layout issue (#7117)\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization: Add support for ASIF drive images.

Removable drives and shared directories can now be ejected and changed while the macOS VM is running. Copy/paste synchronization between macOS 15 guest and host now works when the guest tools are installed (from the CD icon in the toolbar).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue with macOS 15.0 and 15.0.1 where accesses to files will fail due to a permission error. This issue has been resolved with macOS 15.1.\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue on M4 series of Macs where virtualization fails for macOS guests older than 13.4. The issue has been resolved with macOS 15.2.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* v4.6.5 reverted a change from v4.6.4 due to reports of crashes and kernel panics on some machines. As a result, there will be issues when upgrading to Windows 11 24H2 where the screen will go black. An alternative fix with an updated driver will be provided as soon as possible, but for now if you plan to upgrade to Windows 11 24H2, it is recommended you do it from v4.6.4 before updating UTM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.5)\r\n* Reverted virtio-ramfb changes from v4.6.4 due to some users experiencing crashes and kernel panics.

([#6794](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/6794))\r\n* There is a known issue ([#6332](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/6332)) with Windows 11 24H2 that causes the display to show a black screen or \"Guest has not initialized the display (yet)\" upon boot. We recommend not upgrading to 24H2 for existing installs and 23H2 for new installs. If you have already upgraded, please follow the workaround described in the linked issue.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* The update to QEMU v9.1.2 will likely introduce other issues and regressions. If you experience any problem (crashes, performance, errors) that was not evident in v4.5.x, please [open an issue](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and provide all the requested information. It would also be helpful if you can provide a reproducible example and note the last version of UTM where it worked properly.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.2)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v9.1.2 and fixed a crash during Windows setup (x86_64) (#6835)\r\n* Fixed a race condition that causes starting VM to fail with \"QMP stream error seen\"\r\n* (iOS) Fixed DEB install\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a crash when the main bundle executable is not the same as the currently running executable\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a crash on iOS 18 due to namespace collision with internal names\r\n* (iOS) Fixed auto-zoom to fill screen not properly working when Display Zoom is used (#6736)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed TSO mode not working in QEMU\r\n* (macOS) Fixed slow virtualization issues on Intel Macs (#6325)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed boot issues with Windows 11 24H2 (x86_64) (#6772)\r\n* (macOS) Support > 32GiB RAM configurations in QEMU (#5537)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.1)\r\n* Updated SPICE GTK to v0.42, libsoup to v3.6.0, and phodav to 3.0\r\n* Fixed an issue where an empty and broken .utm package is created when creation of VM fails\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* (macOS) Fix fullscreen button showing up as zoom when the dock icon is disabled (thanks @ntoskrnl) (#6269)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue \"With SME enabled, at least one vector length must be enabled.\" when an M4 series Mac is running macOS 15.2 beta (#6790)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed permission issue with EFI vars when installed with Nix (#6725)\r\n* (macOS 13) Enable changing shared directory for newer macOS guests (#6807)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a memory leak caused by an event listener not unregistering after the VM window is closed\r\n* (macOS) Support saving and restoring dynamic resolution when the guest supports it (both QEMU SPICE based and Apple Virtualization based guests)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: added new import and export commands to the Apple Script interface as well as extra QEMU args to the configuration for a new VM (thanks @naveenrajm7) (#6716, #6734, #6741)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed a crash when an invalid .utm package is found\r\n* (macOS 15) Virtualization: Fixed nested virtualization not being set (#6789)\r\n* (macOS 15) Virtualization: Support ejecting and changing removable drives while the VM is running\r\n* (macOS 15) Virtualization: Support installing guest tools for macOS guests\r\n* (macOS 15) Virtualization: Support copy-paste on macOS 15 guests when guest tools is installed\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed alerts not showing up\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed VM download confirmation not showing up when wizard is open (#6820)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.0)\r\n* Updated to QEMU v9.1.0\r\n* Fixed \"RPC timeout\" when stopping a VM\r\n* Fixed a race condition when cleaning up SPICE objects\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS 16+) Home: Always show the sidebar\r\n* (macOS 15) Enable nested virtualization when available\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM-HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM-SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n| UTM-Remote.ipa | Remote client | Any | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

                    "localizedDescription": "**macOS Users:** there is no difference between v4.4.4 and v4.4.5. You do not need to update. \r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **macOS Sonoma support** New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore support for newer iOS** With the release of [TrollStore 2](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), this update brings JIT support for all iOS device that can run TrollStore. If (and only if) you are on at most iOS 16.3.1 AND your device is M1, M2, or A16, then you can also use the virtualization option. No other device or higher iOS version will likely ever be supported due to Apple [removing Hypervisor in iOS 16.4](http://twitter.com/utmapp/status/1708907045314035986). The only way around this is if Apple un-deletes the code (unlikely) or a jailbreak powerful enough to run a custom kernel is released (even more unlikely as this has never been done on a modern iOS device).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.5)\r\n* Fixed a \"device not found\" error when starting a VM with an empty interface (#5845)\r\n* Fixed JIT for TrollStore builds (#5216) (thanks @crstestacc)\r\n* Added support for virtualization on iOS 16.3.1 and lower (M1, M2, A16 only) (thanks @xliuxu)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n* If you suspended an Apple Virtualization VM in v4.4 and then downgrade to v4.3, you will not be able to resume the VM or start it at all. Please make sure you shut down any such VMs before downgrading or you may suffer data loss.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices. However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.\r\n* Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.\r\n* Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)\r\n* Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved\r\n* Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)\r\n* Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)\r\n* Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters\r\n* Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation\r\n* Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.\r\n* Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release\r\n* Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically. This addresses an error that shows up if the Documents directory does not get created properly by macOS.

Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings. (#5358)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @studio1a9)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when AVM window is closed (#5347)\r\n* (macOS) New option \u201cAutomatic\u201d for bridged network connection which will use the bridge the first active connection on the host.

It is based off of QEMU. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Linux, and more on your Mac, iPhone, and iPad. More information at https://getutm.app/ and https://mac.getutm.app/\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"450px\" alt=\"UTM running on an iPhone\" src=\"screen.png\">\n  <br>\n  <img width=\"450px\" alt=\"UTM running on a MacBook\" src=\"screenmac.png\">\n</p>\n\n## Features\n\n* Full system emulation (MMU, devices, etc) using QEMU\n* 30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V\n* VGA graphics mode using SPICE and QXL\n* Text terminal mode\n* USB devices\n* JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG\n* Frontend designed from scratch for macOS 11 and iOS 11+ using the latest and greatest APIs\n* Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device\n\n## Additional macOS Features\n\n* Hardware accelerated virtualization using Hypervisor.framework and QEMU\n* Boot macOS guests with Virtualization.framework on macOS 12+\n\n## UTM SE\n\nUTM/QEMU requires dynamic code generation (JIT) for maximum performance. JIT on iOS devices require either a jailbroken device, or one of the various workarounds found for specific versions of iOS (see \"Install\" for more details).\n\nUTM SE (\"slow edition\") uses a [threaded interpreter][3] which performs better than a traditional interpreter but still slower than JIT. This technique is similar to what [iSH][4] does for dynamic execution. As a result, UTM SE does not require jailbreaking or any JIT workarounds and can be sideloaded as a regular app.\n\nTo optimize for size and build times, only the following architectures are included in UTM SE: ARM, PPC, RISC-V, and x86 (all with both 32-bit and 64-bit variants).\n\n## Install\n\nUTM (SE) for iOS: https://getutm.app/install/\n\nUTM is also available for macOS: https://mac.getutm.app/\n\n## Development\n\n### [macOS Development](Documentation/MacDevelopment.md)\n\n### [iOS Development](Documentation/iOSDevelopment.md)\n\n## Related\n\n* [iSH][4]: emulates a usermode Linux terminal interface for running x86 Linux applications on iOS\n* [a-shell][5]: packages common Unix commands and utilities built natively for iOS and accessible through a terminal interface\n\n## License\n\nUTM is distributed under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.

This will allow you to easily send key commands such as Ctrl+Alt+Del or Stop+A to the VM. (#5698, #6310, #6757)\r\n* Wizard: New option to import an existing drive image when setting up a Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: New option to create a serial port only Linux VM. This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* Wizard: Removed VHDX import option because Microsoft now provides ARM64 ISO images. Note: You can still create manually import an VHDX after creating a new VM.\r\n* Wizard: New template to create classic Mac OS VMs for M68K and PPC (#3504, #6890)\r\n* Wizard: Most common and supported machines for emulation are now listed prominently with the full list of supported QEMU architectures/targets hidden behind an \"Expert\" mode. This is necessary because most of the QEMU targets are not properly supported by the wizard anyways and does not generate a bootable config. They usually require a lot more manual tinkering. The page order of the wizard is also tweaked so the hardware config comes before the boot config now.\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when launching ArchLinux due to mis-handling of REV32\r\n* (iOS SE) Fixed a crash when the first instruction executed is a goto\r\n* (iOS SE) Removed ARM32, RISC-V32, and added M68K. There is little use for ARM32 and RISC-V32 as they cannot boot anything useful that cannot also be booted by the 64-bit variant (which is still included). If you have a counter example of this, please open an issue on GitHub and we can consider re-adding it back in the future. However, removing these will make the app size a lot smaller. M68K is added to support classic Mac OS.\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed guest tools mounting (#7297)\r\n* (macOS 11) Fixed stop button not working (#7298)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a bug where an error message on startup leads to the window being stuck (#7161)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable file locking so VMs can be launched from a network share or a filesystem that does not support locking (#7211)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to disable screenshots completely for privacy reasons (#6620)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New setting to swap Ctrl and Cmd keys in VMs (#4003)\r\n* (macOS 26) Settings: Brand new layout with a sidebar to match other native apps\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Added clearer message when trying to install macOS beta without having the latest beta support tools installed\r\n* (macOS) AVF: New option to resize (expand) disk images (#6891)\r\n* (macOS 26) Fixed a layout issue with the resize image popover\r\n* (macOS) Home: Fixed hide sidebar button\r\n* (macOS) Config: Show localized network adapter names when available (#7287) (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed an issue where wrong UUIDs were generated for display configs (#7145)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.0)\r\n* Updated to QEMU v10.0.2\r\n* Config: In the RAM slider, the maximum value has been increased to 64GiB (note that you can always go above the slider limit by typing in the text box) (#7234)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed crash when VM name is empty (#7245)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Refactored toolbar button layout code\r\n* (macOS) Host only networks: you can set up multiple host-only networks (including ones shared by VMware) and have multiple VMs on the same virtual network (thanks @Schamper)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: added option to boot Apple VMs into recovery mode (thanks @cees-elzinga)\r\n* (macOS) ~~Enable QEMU support for vmapple (#7150)~~ Machine model is removed for stability reasons but `apple-gfx-pci` is still supported for Intel VMs\r\n* (macOS) Rename the main window to 'UTM Library' (#7264)\r\n* (macOS) Display an error when IPSW install fails to load the file (instead of crashing) (#6855)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: Fixed a layout issue (#7117)\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization: Add support for ASIF drive images.

This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* v4.6.5 reverted a change from v4.6.4 due to reports of crashes and kernel panics on some machines. As a result, there will be issues when upgrading to Windows 11 24H2 where the screen will go black.

When TSO is enabled on a guest operating system that is aware of the system register (i.e. Rosetta for Linux), performance of Intel emulation within the guest can be greatly improved. Note that if the guest kernel supports dynamically toggling TSO, you do not need to enable this.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Improved macOS guest support** The last window size (including full screen size) will be restored when the guest supports dynamic resolution. Removable drives and shared directories can now be ejected and changed while the macOS VM is running. Copy/paste synchronization between macOS 15 guest and host now works when the guest tools are installed (from the CD icon in the toolbar).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue with macOS 15.0 and 15.0.1 where accesses to files will fail due to a permission error. This issue has been resolved with macOS 15.1.\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue on M4 series of Macs where virtualization fails for macOS guests older than 13.4. The issue should be addressed by Apple in a future update. ([#6794](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/6794))\r\n* There is a known issue ([#6332](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/6332)) with Windows 11 24H2 that causes the display to show a black screen or \"Guest has not initialized the display (yet)\" upon boot. We recommend not upgrading to 24H2 for existing installs and 23H2 for new installs. If you have already upgraded, please follow the workaround described in the linked issue.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* The update to QEMU v9.1.2 will likely introduce other issues and regressions. If you experience any problem (crashes, performance, errors) that was not evident in v4.5.x, please [open an issue](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and provide all the requested information.

                    "localizedDescription": "**macOS Users:** there is no difference between v4.4.4 and v4.4.5. You do not need to update. \r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **macOS Sonoma support** New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore support for newer iOS** With the release of [TrollStore 2](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), this update brings JIT support for all iOS device that can run TrollStore. If (and only if) you are on at most iOS 16.3.1 AND your device is M1, M2, or A16, then you can also use the virtualization option. No other device or higher iOS version will likely ever be supported due to Apple [removing Hypervisor in iOS 16.4](http://twitter.com/utmapp/status/1708907045314035986). The only way around this is if Apple un-deletes the code (unlikely) or a jailbreak powerful enough to run a custom kernel is released (even more unlikely as this has never been done on a modern iOS device).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.5)\r\n* Fixed a \"device not found\" error when starting a VM with an empty interface (#5845)\r\n* Fixed JIT for TrollStore builds (#5216) (thanks @crstestacc)\r\n* Added support for virtualization on iOS 16.3.1 and lower (M1, M2, A16 only) (thanks @xliuxu)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed keyboard device not showing up on older macOS guests (#5814)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.3)\r\n* Guest Tools: supports caching the latest version and will only re-download when a newer version is available (#5692)\r\n* Fixed a bug where a suspended QEMU VM with a locked CD drive will refuse to resume\r\n* Localization: Updated Russian (thanks @s0rd3s)\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed display scaling sometimes not applying\r\n* (visionOS) Reimplemented multiple-window support with newer APIs and fixes an issue where the main window is resized on startup to the last VM display size\r\n* (visionOS) Process gaze touch events as indirect input\r\n* (visionOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard button was not opening the keyboard and sometimes causes the keyboard to keep popping up after being closed\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where `efi_vars.fd` is locked when the QEMU process deadlocks (#5769)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.2)\r\n* Added some default devices for PPC64 (#5737, #5734)\r\n* Fixed an issue where some VMs refuse to boot (#5745)\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed a memory leak due to a retain cycle\r\n* Fixed an issue where ejecting an ISO or removing a shared directory does not sync after saving (#5708)\r\n* Localization: Added Russian (thanks @s0rd3s)\r\n* Localization: Added Chinese (Hong Kong) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Traditional) (thanks

Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.4)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed keyboard device not showing up on older macOS guests (#5814)\r\n\r\n## Changes

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n* If you suspended an Apple Virtualization VM in v4.4 and then downgrade to v4.3, you will not be able to resume the VM or start it at all. Please make sure you shut down any such VMs before downgrading or you may suffer data loss.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices.

Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings. (#5358)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @studio1a9)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when AVM window is closed (#5347)\r\n* (macOS) New option \u201cAutomatic\u201d for bridged network connection which will use the bridge the first active connection on the host.

                    "localizedDescription": "This version is broken due to a bug which prevents VMs from starting. Please update UTM to the latest version. If you obtained UTM from the Mac App Store, you may need to open the [App Store](itms-apps://apps.apple.com/updates) to the Updates tab to see it.\r\n\r\n## Highlights (Original)\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v8.0.2**\r\n* **Rewrite of QEMU support internals.** Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit), which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nOn i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE.

Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.5)\r\n* Reverted ANGLE to an older version which includes the fix detailed in v4.2.4 but also does not break the Metal backend (#5238)\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj, @mavethee)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the pointer device stopped working on macOS Monterey guests (#5237)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Added option to use emulated trackpad (requires macOS Ventura guest)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`. You should now use similar properties in the `configuration` record\r\n* (macOS) Support changing the audio backend to CoreAudio and make CoreAudio the default (due to better latency and as a workaround to some crashes) (#5125)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.1)\r\n* QEMU: Support more than 8 cores for ARM64 targets (#4847)\r\n* Synchronize time on resume when QEMU guest agent is installed which should fix clock drift issues (#3218)\r\n* (iOS SE) Updated TCTI to latest branch from @ktemkin which has support for vector instructions (#4865)\r\n* (macOS) Switch to emulated trackpad when guest+host are macOS 13+ (second attempt for #4636 and #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the \"raw image\" checkbox when creating a new drive (#5100)\r\n* (macOS) Add PC speaker sound device as an option. You can now add a second sound device on supported targets (x86_64/i386 PC based targets) and set the hardware to PC Speaker to emulate older motherboard speakers.\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: new verbs \"open file\", \"execute\", and \"query ip\" which uses the QEMU guest agent to send commands to the guest. Use the Apple Script Editor's Open Dictionary tool for more information.\r\n* (macOS) CLI: new commands \"file push\", \"file pull\", \"exec\", and \"ip-address\". See `utmctl help` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.0)\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest (27/02/2023) commit\r\n* Automatically revert CPU to \"default\" if model is missing due to updated QEMU (#4910)\r\n* ~~Remove virtio-bus devices (they didn't work) (#4893)~~\r\n* Support drag and drop to import an .utm package (#3599)\r\n* Support copying sparse images across different volumes (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed tearing/performance issue for non-GL accelerated displays when under graphics load (#5049)\r\n* Fixed error when importing a new drive with the same name as an existing drive (#5052)\r\n* ~~Fixed a crash on startup when multiple audio devices are plugged in (#4629)~~\r\n* Wizard: Generate a working configuration for isapc (#4961)\r\n* Settings: Use pretty labels for CPU flags (#4940)\r\n* Translation: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Translation: added Czech readme (thanks @stinovlasmp)\r\n* Translation: updated German (thanks @LostInCompilation and @afh)\r\n* (macOS) Capture Mouse has been renamed to Capture Input and now will show the current capture status as a toggle button\r\n* (macOS) Apple VMs (macOS guests) now support Capture Input which will capture the system keys. This used to be always on as the default. It is now off by default and the toggle button will enable it. (#4667)\r\n* (macOS) Ignore missing links (drives, shared directory, etc) when saving an Apple VM\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to force Num Lock on (#4625)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to prevent idle sleep while VM is running (#4963)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to suppress exit confirmation (#4989)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed delete drive confirmation not showing up on latest macOS\r\n* (macOS) Fixed disposable mode stuck on when a VM is run once in disposable mode (#5025)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where a moved or deleted VM with a stopped window open will attempt to use the old path (#4985)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed cursor scrolling and double click issues (#4636, #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Support following a change in system default input or output audio device (#3488)\r\n* (macOS) Support retry of macOS installation when it fails (the IPSW will not automatically be unlinked)\r\n* (macOS) Support retaining of installer IPSW bookmark across VM moves and UTM restarts (#4938)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n* There is a known bug in newer versions of Mesa which prevents some Wayland applications (such as Firefox) from launching when GPU acceleration is enabled. One workaround is to switch to Xorg from the log-in screen (typically by clicking on the gear icon) and another is to patch Mesa to a newer version.\r\n* Debian 12 fails to load the GUI installer when GPU acceleration is enabled.

                    "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* (iOS SE) **TCTI backend updates**. Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`. You should now use similar properties in the `configuration` record\r\n* (macOS) Support changing the audio backend to CoreAudio and make CoreAudio the default (due to better latency and as a workaround to some crashes) (#5125)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.1)\r\n* QEMU: Support more than 8 cores for ARM64 targets (#4847)\r\n* Synchronize time on resume when QEMU guest agent is installed which should fix clock drift issues (#3218)\r\n* (iOS SE) Updated TCTI to latest branch from @ktemkin which has support for vector instructions (#4865)\r\n* (macOS) Switch to emulated trackpad when guest+host are macOS 13+ (second attempt for #4636 and #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed the \"raw image\" checkbox when creating a new drive (#5100)\r\n* (macOS) Add PC speaker sound device as an option. You can now add a second sound device on supported targets (x86_64/i386 PC based targets) and set the hardware to PC Speaker to emulate older motherboard speakers.\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: new verbs \"open file\", \"execute\", and \"query ip\" which uses the QEMU guest agent to send commands to the guest. Use the Apple Script Editor's Open Dictionary tool for more information.\r\n* (macOS) CLI: new commands \"file push\", \"file pull\", \"exec\", and \"ip-address\". See `utmctl help` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.0)\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest (27/02/2023) commit\r\n* Automatically revert CPU to \"default\" if model is missing due to updated QEMU (#4910)\r\n* ~~Remove virtio-bus devices (they didn't work) (#4893)~~\r\n* Support drag and drop to import an .utm package (#3599)\r\n* Support copying sparse images across different volumes (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed tearing/performance issue for non-GL accelerated displays when under graphics load (#5049)\r\n* Fixed error when importing a new drive with the same name as an existing drive (#5052)\r\n* ~~Fixed a crash on startup when multiple audio devices are plugged in (#4629)~~\r\n* Wizard: Generate a working configuration for isapc (#4961)\r\n* Settings: Use pretty labels for CPU flags (#4940)\r\n* Translation: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Translation: added Czech readme (thanks @stinovlasmp)\r\n* Translation: updated German (thanks @LostInCompilation and @afh)\r\n* (macOS) Capture Mouse has been renamed to Capture Input and now will show the current capture status as a toggle button\r\n* (macOS) Apple VMs (macOS guests) now support Capture Input which will capture the system keys. This used to be always on as the default. It is now off by default and the toggle button will enable it. (#4667)\r\n* (macOS) Ignore missing links (drives, shared directory, etc) when saving an Apple VM\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to force Num Lock on (#4625)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to prevent idle sleep while VM is running (#4963)\r\n* (macOS) Preference: added option to suppress exit confirmation (#4989)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed delete drive confirmation not showing up on latest macOS\r\n* (macOS) Fixed disposable mode stuck on when a VM is run once in disposable mode (#5025)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where a moved or deleted VM with a stopped window open will attempt to use the old path (#4985)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed cursor scrolling and double click issues (#4636, #4645)\r\n* (macOS) Support following a change in system default input or output audio device (#3488)\r\n* (macOS) Support retry of macOS installation when it fails (the IPSW will not automatically be unlinked)\r\n* (macOS) Support retaining of installer IPSW bookmark across VM moves and UTM restarts (#4938)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues) and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n* There is a known bug in newer versions of Mesa which prevents some Wayland applications (such as Firefox) from launching when GPU acceleration is enabled. One workaround is to switch to Xorg from the log-in screen (typically by clicking on the gear icon) and another is to patch Mesa to a newer version.\r\n* Debian 12 fails to load the GUI installer when GPU acceleration is enabled. Please use the text installer instead.\r\n* The Metal renderer backend is broken on macOS, please change your renderer to OpenGL or \"Default\"\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM.HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

The ipa file may not work!\r\n\r\nNotes: RealDebrid and AllDebrid's APIs have drastically changed. It is now impossible to retrieve if an item is cached within their database. Ferrite relies on this type of endpoint for rich display of instantly available magnets.\r\n\r\nThe workaround: A user's magnet library now serves as the instant availability cache. There is now a manual `Download to Debrid` button on the context menu for each search result and bookmark so a user can manually queue a magnet for downloading. If the magnet is instantly available, it'll show the file contents as before and add the magnet to the user's instant availability cache (making the debrid badge green!).\r\n\r\nHere's a picture showing where this new button is located:\r\n![Simulator Screenshot - iPhone 16 Pro - 2024-11-27 at 23 24 38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85735a40-2a4b-4aea-bbfa-b0ba0049b3ec)\r\n\r\nAt this time, I do not recommend using RealDebrid or AllDebrid. However, the above workaround makes these services useable. This UI will improve with upcoming releases.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n- Add a context menu button to manually cache a search result/bookmark to debrid\r\n- Adapt to RealDebrid and AllDebrid's API changes\r\n- Fix settings menu showing if a debrid is enabled or disabled\r\n",
